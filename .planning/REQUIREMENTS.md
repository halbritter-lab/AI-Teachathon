### Structure

- [x] **STRC-01**: Merge Part 3 (AI Timeline) into Part 2 (VC + AI) - eliminate single-slide section

- [x] **STRC-03**: Expand Step 3 ("Code with AI") with example prompt and expected output
- [x] **STRC-04**: Move "Choose Your Tool" before tool category detail slides

### Slide Titles

- [x] **TITL-01**: Revise slide titles from topic labels to takeaway statements per review recommendations

### Marp Features

- [ ] **MARP-01**: Use `bg right/left` split layouts for slides with visuals
- [ ] **MARP-02**: Use `<!-- fit -->` for section break title auto-sizing
- [ ] **MARP-03**: Add `<style scoped>` blocks for per-slide adjustments where needed
- [ ] **MARP-04**: Differentiate section breaks visually (unique color/icon per part)

## Future Requirements

Deferred to later milestones.

### Post-Event

- **POST-01**: Recording/video embed (if event is recorded)
- **POST-02**: Participant feedback form link
- **POST-03**: Gallery of completed pull requests from hands-on session

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| KidneyQuest game screenshot | Game doesn't exist yet - built by participants during event |
| Professional illustrations | Time-constrained; diagrams and screenshots sufficient |
| Animated slides/transitions | Marp doesn't support CSS animations in exported HTML |
| Audience response system (Mentimeter etc.) | Adds external dependency; speaker-note prompts sufficient for now |
