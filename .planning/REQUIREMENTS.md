## v1.1 Requirements

Requirements for presentation revision. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Content Additions

- [ ] **CONT-01**: Add concise private vs public repos slide (when to use which, medical research default)
- [ ] **CONT-02**: Add concise .gitignore slide (what it is, what to ignore, first defense against data leaks)
- [ ] **CONT-03**: Add concise PII management slide (never commit patient data, API keys, what-if-you-do)
- [ ] **CONT-04**: Expand commit messages slide with conventional commits format (feat/fix/docs types)
- [ ] **CONT-05**: Add concise semantic versioning slide (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, why researchers care)

### Visual Elements

- [ ] **VIS-01**: Add branch/merge diagram to branches slide (Marp split layout)
- [ ] **VIS-02**: Add visual timeline graphic for AI revolution slide
- [ ] **VIS-03**: Capture and embed real tool screenshots (ChatGPT, Copilot in VS Code, Claude Code terminal)
- [ ] **VIS-04**: Add 5-step workflow diagram to workflow overview slide
- [ ] **VIS-05**: Store all presentation images in `docs/presentation/images/`

### Learning Objectives

- [ ] **OBJ-01**: Add "What You'll Learn Today" slide after title slide
- [ ] **OBJ-02**: Add "What You Now Know" recap slide before closing CTA

### Engagement

- [ ] **ENG-02**: Add at least 1 dedicated question slide with large text

### Structure

- [ ] **STRC-01**: Merge Part 3 (AI Timeline) into Part 2 (VC + AI) - eliminate single-slide section
- [ ] **STRC-02**: Combine Steps 1-2 (clone + branch) into single slide
- [ ] **STRC-03**: Expand Step 3 ("Code with AI") with example prompt and expected output
- [ ] **STRC-04**: Move "Choose Your Tool" before tool category detail slides

### Slide Titles

- [ ] **TITL-01**: Revise slide titles from topic labels to takeaway statements per review recommendations

### Marp Features

- [ ] **MARP-01**: Use `bg right/left` split layouts for slides with visuals
- [ ] **MARP-02**: Use `<!-- fit -->` for section break title auto-sizing
- [ ] **MARP-03**: Add `<style scoped>` blocks for per-slide adjustments where needed
- [ ] **MARP-04**: Differentiate section breaks visually (unique color/icon per part)

## Future Requirements

Deferred to later milestones.

### Post-Event

- **POST-01**: Recording/video embed (if event is recorded)
- **POST-02**: Participant feedback form link
- **POST-03**: Gallery of completed pull requests from hands-on session

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| KidneyQuest game screenshot | Game doesn't exist yet - built by participants during event |
| Professional illustrations | Time-constrained; diagrams and screenshots sufficient |
| Animated slides/transitions | Marp doesn't support CSS animations in exported HTML |
| Audience response system (Mentimeter etc.) | Adds external dependency; speaker-note prompts sufficient for now |
