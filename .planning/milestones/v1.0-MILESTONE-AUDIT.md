# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

**Milestone:** v1.0 - AI Teachathon Website
**Audited:** 2026-02-17T12:00:00Z
**Status:** TECH DEBT (no blockers, accumulated process gaps)

## Executive Summary

All 33 v1 requirements are functionally satisfied. The site is complete with all 7 content pages, a 25-slide Marp presentation, working build pipeline, GitHub Actions deployment, Playwright tests, and full cross-page integration. However, two phases (01, 03) were never formally verified through the GSD workflow, and their tracking artifacts (summaries, verification reports) are missing.

## Requirements Coverage

**Flows verified: 4/4**

## Tech Debt

### Phase 01: Scaffold & Deploy (3 items)

1. **Missing 01-VERIFICATION.md** - Phase was never formally verified through the GSD workflow. Work is demonstrably complete (site builds, deploys, all infra requirements met) but the verification artifact was never created.

2. **Missing 01-02-SUMMARY.md** - Plan 02 (placeholder pages + GitHub Actions) was executed and tasks completed, but the summary was never written. ROADMAP notes "tasks 1-2 done, awaiting checkpoint."

3. **REQUIREMENTS.md traceability outdated** - INFRA-01 through INFRA-06 still listed as "Pending" in the traceability table despite being functionally complete.

### Phase 03: Presentation (3 items)

1. **Missing 03-VERIFICATION.md** - Phase was never formally verified. The presentation exists (398-line slides.md, 105KB presentation.html) but no verification report was created.

2. **Missing 03-02-SUMMARY.md** - Slides were written (plan 02 executed) but the summary artifact was never created. The plan exists with detailed tasks but execution was not formally tracked.

3. **REQUIREMENTS.md traceability outdated** - PRES-01 through PRES-04 still listed as "Pending" in the traceability table despite being functionally complete.

### Phase 04: Knowledge Pages (1 item)

1. **Pre-existing TODO in hands-on.md** - Noted by Phase 05 verifier as informational. The word "placeholder" appears in instructional context (telling users to replace bracketed placeholders in AI prompts), not as a content stub.

**Total: 7 items across 3 phases**

## Human Verification Items (from Phase 05)

The following were flagged by the Phase 05 verifier as requiring manual confirmation:

1. External link validation (spot-check 5-6 links in resources.md)
2. Edit-on-GitHub link functionality (requires GitHub auth)
3. Mobile navigation flow (hamburger menu, touch interactions)
4. Presentation fullscreen mode (F11, slide navigation)
5. Cross-link navigation flow (end-to-end click-through)
6. Content quality assessment (readability, tone, typos)

## Conclusion

**All 33 v1 requirements are functionally satisfied.** The site is complete and integrated. No critical gaps or blockers exist.

The tech debt is entirely process-related: missing GSD tracking artifacts (verification reports, summaries) for phases 01 and 03, and an outdated traceability table in REQUIREMENTS.md. The actual deliverables are in place and working.
