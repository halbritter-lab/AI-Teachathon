## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- VitePress + Tailwind CSS v4 + Marp (modern Markdown-first stack)
- Dark theme with purple/pink/cyan gradient (playful hackathon vibe)
- Marp over Reveal.js for presentations (better Markdown-first workflow)
- Flat sidebar navigation following event flow order
- Platform-visible setup instructions (H3 headings, not tabs)
- 8-step Git workflow covering full GitHub Flow
- Resources organized by journey timeline (Before/During/After)
- Chromium-only Playwright tests (fast install, sufficient coverage)

**Issues Resolved:**

- VitePress SPA router 404s on static HTML from public/ (fixed with Vite middleware)
- Marp CSS `:root.invert` selector doesn't match in SVG foreignObject (use `section` selector)
- Fragment animations (`*` bullets) hide content in static view (switched to `-` bullets)

**Issues Deferred:**

- Missing 01-02-SUMMARY.md and 03-02-SUMMARY.md (process gap, work is complete)
- Missing 01-VERIFICATION.md and 03-VERIFICATION.md (process gap, requirements satisfied)
- REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table outdated for Phase 1 and Phase 3 (fixed in archive)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- None significant - site is complete and functional for the event
