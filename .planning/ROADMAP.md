## Phase 1: Scaffold & Deploy

**Goal:** Get a working VitePress + Tailwind site live on GitHub Pages with dark theme, search, and navigation.

**Why first:** Deploy early. Verify the full pipeline works before writing any real content. Every subsequent phase deploys automatically.

**Requirements:** INFRA-01, INFRA-02, INFRA-03, INFRA-04, INFRA-05, INFRA-06

**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md - Initialize VitePress + Tailwind v4 with dark theme *(complete)*
- [ ] 01-02-PLAN.md - Create placeholder pages + GitHub Actions deployment *(tasks 1-2 done, awaiting checkpoint)*

**Success Criteria:**
1. `npm run docs:dev` serves site locally with hot reload and auto-open
2. `npm run docs:build` produces static output without errors
3. GitHub Actions workflow builds and deploys on push to main
4. Site loads at berntpopp.github.io/AI-Teachathon/ with dark theme
5. Search bar appears and indexes placeholder content
6. Sidebar navigation shows correct page order
7. `make check` passes (lint + format + build)

**Key tasks:**
- Initialize VitePress project
- Install and configure Tailwind CSS v4 via @tailwindcss/vite
- Configure dark color scheme with playful purple/pink/cyan accents
- Configure modern dev server (auto-open, HMR overlay, lastUpdated, metaChunk)
- Create GitHub Actions workflow for Pages deployment
- Create placeholder .md files for all pages with correct nav ordering
- Add Makefile, Prettier, and markdownlint for DX quality
- Push and verify live deployment

## Phase 2: Core Content

**Goal:** Write the three most critical pages: landing page, setup guide, and agenda. These are what participants see first and must be self-service.

**Why second:** Setup guide is the most time-sensitive - participants need it before the event to prepare. Landing page is the entry point. Agenda tells them what to expect.

**Requirements:** LAND-01, LAND-02, LAND-03, SETUP-01, SETUP-02, SETUP-03, SETUP-04, SETUP-05, AGND-01, AGND-02, AGND-03

**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md - Landing page with hero, CTA cards, and footer branding *(complete)*
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md - Setup guide with platform-specific instructions and verification checklist *(complete)*
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md - Agenda page with vertical timeline component *(complete)*

**Success Criteria:**
1. Landing page shows event name, date/time (Feb 17, 17:00), location, and description
2. Landing page has three clear CTAs linking to setup, agenda, and ideas
3. Setup guide has platform-specific instructions for VS Code, Git, GitHub
4. Setup guide has verification steps with expected outputs
5. Setup guide ends with a completion checklist
6. Agenda shows timeline from 17:00 to ~20:00 with all segments
7. Each agenda segment links to its relevant page

**Content tone:** Approachable, encouraging. Friendly and casual. No research analogies.

---

## Phase 3: Presentation

**Goal:** Build the Marp presentation for the "Why & What" opening segment (~30 min).

**Why third:** The presentation is shown on the projector and is the centerpiece of the first 30 minutes. It must engage non-technical researchers.

**Requirements:** PRES-01, PRES-02, PRES-03, PRES-04

**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 03-01-PLAN.md - Set up Marp toolchain, custom theme, build scripts, and site integration
- [ ] 03-02-PLAN.md - Write ~25 slides with full narrative arc, speaker notes, and visual verification

**Success Criteria:**
1. presentation.html generated by Marp CLI loads without errors
2. Slides cover: title, version control problem, Git, GitHub, AI + VCS, AI timeline, tool landscape, KidneyQuest preview
3. Dark theme with teal/cyan accents on dark background
4. Fragment animations reveal content progressively
5. Speaker notes are present on every slide
6. Keyboard navigation works (arrows, p for presenter mode)
7. "Back to course" link returns to main site

**Content principles:** One idea per slide. Large text. No code on slides. Light research analogies (1-2 only). ~25 slides.

---

## Phase 4: Knowledge Pages

**Goal:** Write the AI tool landscape overview and the hands-on session guide - the two reference pages used during the workshop.

**Why fourth:** These pages are used during the event itself. The tool landscape supports the 20-min segment, the hands-on guide supports the 2-hour coding session.

**Requirements:** TOOL-01, TOOL-02, TOOL-03, TOOL-04, HAND-01, HAND-02, HAND-03

**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md - AI tool landscape: 4-level evolution spectrum, 10 tool cards, 5 practical tips *(complete)*
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md - Hands-on guide: Git workflow steps, KidneyQuest framing, AI prompting guide *(complete)*

**Success Criteria:**
1. AI tool landscape shows 4-level spectrum with examples at each level
2. Comparison table lists tools with type, best for, cost, and recommendation
3. 5 practical tips for working with AI tools are clear and actionable
4. Tool information is current as of Feb 2026
5. KidneyQuest concept is described with CeRKiD zebra context
6. Step-by-step Git workflow covers clone through PR with copy-paste commands
7. Example AI prompts are specific and task-relevant

---

## Phase 5: Community & Polish

**Goal:** Add the ideas page, resources page, enable edit-on-GitHub links, and run final QA with Playwright tests for cross-links, responsive design, and presentation rendering.

**Why last:** These pages are lower priority and the polish pass ensures everything works together.

**Requirements:** IDEA-01, IDEA-02, IDEA-03, RSRC-01, RSRC-02, RSRC-03

**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md - Ideas page (KidneyQuest featured, 4 project ideas, pain points) + editLink config *(complete - done during Phase 4 execution)*
- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md - Resources page (journey-organized links: Before/During/After + Explore Further) *(complete - done during Phase 4 execution)*
- [x] 05-03-PLAN.md - Playwright QA (link validation, responsive tests, presentation rendering) *(complete)*

**Success Criteria:**
1. Ideas page has 3-4 starter project ideas relevant to nephrology/genetics research
2. Ideas page has an edit-on-GitHub link
3. Resources page has curated links organized by category
4. All internal cross-links work (agenda -> presentation, setup -> GitHub, etc.)
5. All external links are valid and load correctly
6. Site is readable on mobile (test at 375px width)
7. Presentation works in fullscreen on 1024x768 viewport

## Risk Log

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| npm/Node version issues | Build fails | Pin Node version in GitHub Actions, test locally first |
| Tailwind + VitePress CSS conflicts | Broken styling | Use @layer directives, test preflight interaction |
| Marp theme conflicts | Presentation styling broken | Standalone HTML with scoped styles, test in browser |
| GitHub Pages baseurl wrong | All links broken | Set base: '/AI-Teachathon/' in config, test deployed URL |
| Content too technical | Audience disengages | Write for researchers, use analogies, avoid jargon |
