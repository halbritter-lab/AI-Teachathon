<objective>
Create all placeholder content pages, finalize the landing page hero, and add the GitHub Actions deployment workflow.

Purpose: Complete the full site structure so search indexes real pages, navigation works end-to-end, and the CI/CD pipeline is ready for automatic deployment on merge to main.
Output: 7 markdown pages with placeholder content, 1 GitHub Actions workflow file, and a verified build.
</objective>

    Update `docs/index.md` (may already exist as minimal placeholder from Plan 01) to the full hero layout:
    ```markdown

    layout: home

    hero:
      name: AI-Teachathon
      text: Halbritter Lab
      tagline: Learn Git, GitHub & AI Tools — Hands On
      actions:
        - theme: brand
          text: Get Started
          link: /setup
        - theme: alt
          text: View Agenda
          link: /agenda

    features:
      - title: Hands-On Learning
        details: Build a real project using Git, GitHub, and AI coding assistants in a guided workshop.
      - title: AI Tool Landscape
        details: Explore the spectrum of AI tools from chatbots to autonomous agents — and learn when to use each.
      - title: Collaborative Projects
        details: Contribute ideas and code to open-source projects like KidneyQuest.
    ---
    ```

    The landing page uses `layout: home` which disables the sidebar (per CONTEXT.md: "no sidebar on index"). The hero has two CTA buttons linking to /setup and /agenda. Features section gives three content previews.

    Create 6 placeholder content pages. Each page should have:
    - A descriptive h1 title
    - A brief paragraph explaining what the page will contain (helps search indexing)
    - A "Coming soon" notice
    - Enough text for search to index meaningfully (3-5 sentences minimum)

    `docs/setup.md`:
    ```markdown
    # Setup Guide

    Get your development environment ready before the workshop. This guide walks you through installing VS Code, Git, and creating a GitHub account.

    > This page is under construction. Full setup instructions will be available before the event.

    ## What You'll Need

    - **VS Code** — A modern code editor with AI assistant support
    - **Git** — Version control to track your changes
    - **GitHub Account** — Where we collaborate and share code

    ## Estimated Time

    Setting up takes about 15-20 minutes. We recommend completing this before the workshop starts.
    ```

    `docs/agenda.md`:
    ```markdown
    # Agenda

    The AI-Teachathon runs on February 17, 2026 from 17:00 to approximately 20:00. Here's what we'll cover during the workshop.

    > This page is under construction. The full timeline with session details will be added soon.

    ## Overview

    - **17:00** — Welcome and introduction
    - **17:15** — Why AI and version control matter for research
    - **17:45** — AI tool landscape overview
    - **18:00** — Break
    - **18:15** — Hands-on coding session
    - **~20:00** — Wrap-up and next steps
    ```

    `docs/ai-tools.md`:
    ```markdown
    # AI Tools

    An overview of the AI tool landscape for researchers — from simple chatbots to autonomous coding agents. Learn what's available and when to use each tool.

    > This page is under construction. A comprehensive tool comparison will be added soon.

    ## The AI Spectrum

    AI coding tools range from conversational assistants to fully autonomous agents. Understanding this spectrum helps you pick the right tool for the job.

    ## What We'll Cover

    - Chatbots (ChatGPT, Claude)
    - Code completion (GitHub Copilot, Cursor)
    - CLI tools and agents
    - Practical tips for working with AI
    ```

    # Hands-On Guide

    The centerpiece of the workshop: a guided coding session where you'll use Git, GitHub, and AI tools to build something real.

    > This page is under construction. Step-by-step instructions will be added before the event.

    ## What We'll Build

    During the hands-on session, you'll work through a real Git workflow — from cloning a repository to submitting a pull request — with AI assistants helping along the way.

    ## Skills You'll Practice

    - Cloning and branching in Git
    - Making changes and committing
    - Creating pull requests on GitHub
    - Using AI tools to write and review code
    ```

    `docs/ideas.md`:
    ```markdown
    # Project Ideas

    Explore project ideas for the hands-on session and beyond. These projects are designed for researchers in nephrology and genetics.

    > This page is under construction. Starter project ideas will be added soon.

    ## Featured Project

    **KidneyQuest** — An educational game about rare kidney diseases, built with web technologies and AI assistance.

    ## Contribute Your Ideas

    Have a project idea? We welcome contributions from all participants.
    ```

    `docs/resources.md`:
    ```markdown
    # Resources

    Curated links, references, and further reading to continue your learning journey after the workshop.

    > This page is under construction. Links and references will be added soon.

    ## Categories

    - Git and GitHub tutorials
    - AI tool documentation
    - Research computing resources
    - Community and support channels
    ```

    IMPORTANT: Do NOT add `sidebar: false` to any content page frontmatter — only the index page uses `layout: home` which automatically hides the sidebar. All other pages should show the sidebar.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `npm run docs:build` and confirm it completes without errors.
    Verify all 7 markdown files exist in `docs/` directory.
    Check that built output in `docs/.vitepress/dist/` contains HTML files for each page (setup.html, agenda.html, etc.).
  </verify>
  <done>
    All 7 pages render correctly. Landing page shows hero with gradient title, tagline, CTA buttons, and feature cards. Content pages show in sidebar in correct order. Build succeeds with all pages included. Search can find content across all placeholder pages.

            id: deployment
            uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
    ```

    CRITICAL details:
    - Upload artifact path is `docs/.vitepress/dist` (NOT `.vitepress/dist`) because we use the `docs/` subdirectory structure
    - Node.js 22 LTS per research recommendations
    - `npm ci` not `npm install` for deterministic CI builds
    - `fetch-depth: 0` for VitePress git-based features (last updated timestamps)
    - Triggers on push to main AND manual dispatch
    - Permissions: `pages: write` and `id-token: write` required for GitHub Pages deployment
    - Concurrency group prevents parallel deployments

    Do NOT:
    - Add a `.nojekyll` file -- GitHub Actions bypasses Jekyll automatically
    - Use `actions/setup-pages` -- the correct action is `actions/configure-pages`
  </action>
  <verify>
    Verify `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` exists and is valid YAML (no syntax errors).
    Run `npm run docs:build` one final time to confirm the full pipeline works locally.
    Check that the artifact path in the workflow matches the actual build output directory.
  </verify>
  <done>
    GitHub Actions workflow exists at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. It targets main branch, uses Node.js 22, runs the VitePress build, and deploys to GitHub Pages. The artifact upload path correctly points to `docs/.vitepress/dist`.
