<objective>
Write all ~25 slides for the "Why and What" opening presentation, covering the full narrative arc from the filename joke through Git/GitHub basics, AI + version control synergy, tool landscape overview, to the KidneyQuest hands-on preview. Include speaker notes on every slide and fragment animations for progressive reveal.

Purpose: This is the centerpiece of the first 30 minutes of the workshop. It must engage non-technical researchers and get them excited about Git, AI tools, and the hands-on session.

Output: Complete slides.md with ~25 slides and generated presentation.html ready for the projector.

Replace the test content in `docs/presentation/slides.md` with the full ~25-slide presentation. The file already has correct frontmatter from Plan 01 (theme: teachathon, class: invert, size: 16:9, paginate: true, header/footer).

The existing `.planning/start.md` prototype can be referenced for structure ideas but the content should be rewritten to match CONTEXT.md decisions.

**Narrative Arc (follow this order, exact slide count is flexible within sections):**

**Section 1: Opening (2-3 slides)**
- Title slide: "Git, GitHub and AI Tools" (or similar), subtitle with AI-Teachathon / Halbritter Lab, date Feb 17 2025. Use `<!-- _class: lead -->` for centered layout. No paginate on title slide (`<!-- _paginate: false -->`).
- The filename joke: Show `final_v3_REALLY_final.docx` progression. Frame it as "we've all been there" then pivot to "there's a better way - and it's the key to working with AI". This is the hook.
- Real consequences: "What if you need to reproduce results from 6 months ago?" Frame version control as essential, not optional.

**Section 2: Git Basics (5-6 slides)**
- What is a repository: "Like a lab notebook for your code - every change tracked automatically". Use this ONE research analogy, then switch to real terms.
- Commits: Snapshots of your project. Use `*` bullet markers for progressive fragment reveal. Keep it simple - save points.
- Branches: "Like running a parallel experiment without affecting the main project". Second and last research analogy. Then explain: you work on your branch, main stays safe.
- Pull Requests: How you propose changes. Someone reviews, then merges. This is collaboration.
- Git vs GitHub: Git = the tool on your computer. GitHub = the website where you share and collaborate. Brief, clear distinction.

**Section 3: Why VCS Matters with AI (2-3 slides)**
- AI generates lots of code fast - you need to track what changed and why
- Version control lets you experiment freely - roll back if AI suggestions don't work
- The combination: Git + AI = you can try bold things safely

**Section 4: AI Revolution Timeline (1-2 slides)**
- Brief 2022-2026 timeline: ChatGPT launch (Nov 2022) -> GitHub Copilot (2022) -> Claude, GPT-4 (2023) -> Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf (2024-2025) -> Now: AI writes significant portions of code
- Emphasize acceleration - "this is moving fast, and that's why we're here today"

**Section 5: Tool Landscape (3-4 slides)**
- The spectrum: Chat-based (ChatGPT, Claude.ai) -> IDE sidebar (Copilot, Cursor) -> CLI agents (Claude Code, Codex CLI)
- Each level: what it's good for, when to use it. Keep it simple, one idea per slide.
- "Choose your tool" slide: Participants will pick their preferred tool for the hands-on. No single right answer. Chat is fine. Sidebar is fine. CLI is fine. Use what feels comfortable.
- Reference: "The AI Tools page on the course site has detailed comparisons" (links to Phase 4 content)

**Section 6: What We'll Do Today (2-3 slides)**
- KidneyQuest preview: A simple browser game where the CeRKiD zebra collects genes. Show the concept (describe it with words/simple diagram - no screenshots per CONTEXT.md "no photos, no illustrations").
- The workflow they'll follow: Clone the repo -> Create a branch -> Code with AI assistance -> Open a Pull Request -> Review and merge
- Each step is simple. "This is easier than it looks."

**Section 7: Closing (1-2 slides)**
- "Let's get started!" - encouraging, energetic
- Back-to-course link: Include a link back to the AI-Teachathon VitePress site. Format as an HTML anchor if needed (remember `--html` flag is enabled in the build). Use the deployed URL pattern: `https://berntpopp.github.io/AI-Teachathon/`
- Or alternatively, use a simple text reference: "Course site: berntpopp.github.io/AI-Teachathon/"

**Formatting Rules:**
- Use `---` as slide separators (standard Marp)
- Use `-` for bullet points (NOT `*` which triggers hidden fragment animations in Marp)
- Use `<!-- _class: lead -->` for centered title/section-divider slides
- Use scoped directives with underscore prefix (`_backgroundColor`, `_class`) for single-slide overrides
- Speaker notes go in HTML comments: `<!-- speaker note text -->`
- Speaker notes should be minimal - key reminders only, NOT full talking points
- ONE idea per slide. Large text. No code blocks on slides.
- No emojis (per project conventions)
- No photos, illustrations, or icons - only text and simple ASCII/text diagrams if needed
- Keep total slide count around 20-25

**Tone:** Casual and encouraging. Like a lab meeting, not a lecture. "This is easier than it looks." Standard English - the audience reads papers in English.

4. Check that all bullet content is visible immediately (no fragment animations)
5. Press `p` to open presenter mode - verify speaker notes are visible
6. Check the closing slide has a working back-to-course link
7. Verify there are approximately 20-25 slides total (check page count in bottom corner)
8. Verify tone is casual/encouraging, not lecturing
9. Verify no code blocks, photos, icons, or emojis appear on slides
