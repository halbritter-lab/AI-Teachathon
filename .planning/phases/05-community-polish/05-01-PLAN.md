<objective>
Write the complete ideas page content (KidneyQuest featured project, 4 alternative project ideas, pain points section, contribution invitation) and enable edit-on-GitHub links globally via VitePress editLink config.

Purpose: The ideas page inspires participants to choose or propose projects for the hands-on session. The editLink enables community contributions across the entire site.
Output: Fully written docs/ideas.md and updated config.mts with editLink.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write complete ideas page</name>
  <files>docs/ideas.md</files>
  <action>
Replace the placeholder content in docs/ideas.md with the full ideas page. Use standard VitePress doc layout (NOT home layout with hero). Structure as follows:

**Title and intro:**
- Title: "Project Ideas"
- Brief intro paragraph: casual tone, explain these are real project ideas from participants, encourage picking one or proposing your own

**Featured Project - KidneyQuest:**
- Prominent section with H2 heading
- Description: an educational game about rare kidney diseases, built with web technologies and AI assistance
- Mention CeRKiD zebra mascot connection
- Link to the hands-on guide: `[hands-on guide](/hands-on)`
- Mention it's the main workshop project everyone will work on together

**Alternative Project Ideas (H2 section):**
- Brief intro: "Looking to explore something different? These ideas come from fellow participants."
- 4 projects, each as H3 with title, one paragraph description, and a "Stack:" line:

1. **Genomic Variant Effect Prediction with AlphaGenome** -- Use Google DeepMind's AlphaGenome API to predict how patient variants affect gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Starts from a Colab notebook. Stack: Python, Google Colab, AlphaGenome API.

2. **Research Data Management Dashboard** -- Desktop app with data entry forms, SQLite database, automated analysis, and visual dashboard. Stack: Electron, Vue/Vite, SQLite.

3. **AI-Assisted Academic Writing Pipeline** -- Combine Zotero (references), QuillBot (paraphrasing), and GPTZero (AI detection) into a research writing workflow. Stack: Zotero, QuillBot, GPTZero, markdown editor.

4. **AI-Powered RNAseq Enrichment Summarizer** -- Feed enrichment results to an LLM via API, get plain-language summaries, validate with LLM-as-judge approach. Cover: initial prompt design, hallucination avoidance, LLM-as-judge validation, API usage. Stack: Python, OpenAI/Anthropic API.

**What Could AI Help With? (H2 section):**
- Brief intro: for participants who don't have a specific project yet, here are common research pain points where AI can help
- List 5-6 pain points as bullet points with brief (1 sentence) explanations:
  - Literature review and summarization
  - Data cleaning and reformatting
  - Writing and editing manuscripts
  - Debugging code and scripts
  - Generating boilerplate code for repetitive tasks
  - Creating visualizations from data

**Contribution invitation (end of page):**
- Simple one-liner at the bottom: "Have a project idea? [Edit this page](link) and add it -- that's what contributing on GitHub looks like."
- The edit link text should work with the editLink feature (VitePress adds the link automatically in the footer, but include an inline mention here too using the pattern: `https://github.com/berntpopp/AI-Teachathon/edit/main/docs/ideas.md`)

**Tone:** Same casual, friendly voice as rest of site. Use "you" and contractions. No jargon without inline definitions. No emojis.

**Do NOT use:**
- Home layout (use default doc layout)
- Feature cards or structured card components
- Emojis (per no-emojis-homepage decision)
  </action>
  <verify>
- File exists and has 80+ lines of content
- Contains "KidneyQuest" in a prominent section
- Contains all 4 project idea titles (AlphaGenome, Data Management, Academic Writing, RNAseq)
- Contains "What Could AI Help With" section
- Contains contribution invitation with GitHub edit link
- `npm run lint` passes (or fix any lint issues)
- `npm run format:check` passes (or run format first)
  </verify>
  <done>Ideas page has KidneyQuest featured, 4 alternative projects with stack info, 5-6 pain points, and contribution invitation with edit link</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Enable editLink in VitePress config</name>
  <files>docs/.vitepress/config.mts</files>
  <action>
Add the editLink configuration to the existing themeConfig in docs/.vitepress/config.mts. Add it inside the `themeConfig` object, after the existing `search` property:

```typescript
editLink: {
  pattern: 'https://github.com/berntpopp/AI-Teachathon/edit/main/docs/:path',
  text: 'Edit this page on GitHub'
},
```

This enables the "Edit this page on GitHub" link on every page. The `:path` placeholder is automatically replaced by VitePress with the page's source file path.

Do NOT modify any other config properties. Only add editLink.

After adding, run `npm run format` to ensure consistent formatting, then verify with `npm run docs:build` that the site still builds.
  </action>
  <verify>
- `grep -c "editLink" docs/.vitepress/config.mts` returns at least 1
- `grep -c ":path" docs/.vitepress/config.mts` returns at least 1
- `npm run docs:build` completes without errors
- `npm run format:check` passes
  </verify>
  <done>Every page on the site displays an "Edit this page on GitHub" link pointing to the correct source file on GitHub</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `npm run docs:build` succeeds
- `npm run lint` passes
- `npm run format:check` passes
- Ideas page renders with all sections when viewed in dev server
- Edit link appears in footer of pages when viewed in dev server
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Ideas page has KidneyQuest featured project, 4 alternative ideas, pain points section, and contribution invitation
- editLink globally enabled on all pages via config.mts
- Site builds without errors
- Content tone matches rest of site (casual, friendly, no emojis)
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-community-polish/05-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
