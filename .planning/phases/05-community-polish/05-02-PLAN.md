Purpose: Gives participants a single reference page for all external learning resources, organized by when they're most useful relative to the workshop.
Output: Fully written docs/resources.md.

  <name>Task 1: Write complete resources page</name>
  <files>docs/resources.md</files>
  <action>
Replace the placeholder content in docs/resources.md with the full resources page. Use standard VitePress doc layout. Structure as follows:

**Title and intro:**
- Title: "Resources"
- Brief intro: these are curated links to help you before, during, and after the workshop. Bookmark this page for quick reference.

**Before the Event (H2):**
Links participants need to prepare. Just titles with links, no descriptions. Include:
- [Git Cheat Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) (GitHub Education)
- [GitHub Skills](https://skills.github.com/) (interactive courses)
- [Oh Shit, Git!?!](https://ohshitgit.com/) (common Git mistakes and fixes)
- [Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) (free, comprehensive reference)
- [VS Code Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)
- Cross-link to the site's own setup guide: [Setup Guide](/setup)

**During the Event (H2):**
Links useful while working through the workshop. Include:
- [GitHub Copilot Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot)
- [Claude Code Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
- [Cursor Editor](https://cursor.sh/)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (if participants prefer GUI over CLI)
- Cross-link to the site's own AI tools page: [AI Tools Overview](/ai-tools)
- Cross-link to hands-on guide: [Hands-On Guide](/hands-on)

**After the Event (H2):**
Links for continued learning after the workshop. Include:
- [DeepLearning.AI Short Courses](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/)
- [fast.ai Practical Deep Learning](https://course.fast.ai/)
- [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/)
- [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) (MIT)
- [Codecademy: Learn Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git)

**Explore Further (H2):**
Project-specific links for participants working on the alternative project ideas. Include:
- AlphaGenome: [AlphaGenome Documentation](https://alphagenomedocs.com/) and [Colab Notebooks](https://alphagenomedocs.com/colabs/)
- Electron/Vue: [Electron Documentation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs) and [Vue.js Guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction)
- Zotero: [Zotero Documentation](https://www.zotero.org/support/)
- QuillBot: [QuillBot](https://quillbot.com/)
- GPTZero: [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/)
- OpenAI API: [OpenAI API Docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs)

**Format rules:**
- Links with titles only, no descriptions per link (user decision)
- Use unordered lists (bullet points) for links within each section
- No emojis
- Casual, friendly tone in intro and section headers
- Cross-links to internal pages use relative paths (e.g., `/setup`, `/ai-tools`, `/hands-on`)
  </action>
  <verify>
- File exists and has 60+ lines of content
- Contains all 4 section headings: "Before the Event", "During the Event", "After the Event", "Explore Further"
- Contains cross-links to /setup, /ai-tools, /hands-on
- Contains external links (github.com, docs.anthropic.com, etc.)
- `npm run lint` passes
- `npm run format:check` passes (or run format first)
  </verify>
  <done>Resources page has journey-organized links (Before/During/After) plus Explore Further section, all with titles only, matching site tone</done>
