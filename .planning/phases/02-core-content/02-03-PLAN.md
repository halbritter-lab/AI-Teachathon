<objective>
Create the agenda page with a polished vertical timeline component showing the event flow from 17:00 to ~20:00, with each segment linking to its relevant content page.

Purpose: Participants need to know what to expect and when. The timeline should communicate that this is a relaxed, interactive evening -- not a rigid lecture schedule. The visual timeline with dots and connecting lines makes the flow intuitive.
Output: A Timeline.vue component registered globally, and a complete agenda.md using it.

    **Create the Timeline component:**

    Create directory `docs/.vitepress/theme/components/` if it doesn't exist.

    Create `docs/.vitepress/theme/components/Timeline.vue`:

    This is a vertical timeline with dots connected by a line. Each segment shows time, title, description, and an optional link. The component must work in both light and dark mode using VitePress CSS variables and Tailwind classes.

    ```vue
    <template>
      <div class="timeline-container">
        <ol class="relative border-s-2 border-[var(--vp-c-divider)] ms-4">
          <li
            v-for="(segment, index) in segments"
            :key="index"
            class="mb-10 ms-8 last:mb-0"

                ? 'bg-[var(--vp-c-brand-1)]'
                : 'bg-[var(--vp-c-divider)]'"
            />

            <!-- Time label -->
            <time class="mb-1 block text-sm font-normal leading-none text-[var(--vp-c-text-3)]">
              {{ segment.time }}
            </time>

            <!-- Title -->
            <h3 class="mt-1 text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--vp-c-text-1)]">
              {{ segment.title }}
            </h3>

            <!-- Description -->
            <p class="mt-1 text-base text-[var(--vp-c-text-2)]">
              {{ segment.description }}
            </p>

            <!-- Optional link -->
            <a
              v-if="segment.link"
              :href="segment.link"
              class="mt-2 inline-flex items-center text-sm font-medium text-[var(--vp-c-brand-1)] hover:underline"
            >
              {{ segment.linkText || 'Learn more' }} →
            </a>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </template>

    <script setup lang="ts">
    interface TimelineSegment {
      time: string
      title: string
      description: string
      link?: string
      linkText?: string
      highlight?: boolean
    }

    defineProps<{
      segments: TimelineSegment[]
    }>()
    </script>

    <style scoped>
    .timeline-container {
      padding: 1rem 0;
      max-width: 640px;
    }
    </style>
    ```

    Key design decisions:
    - Uses VitePress CSS variables (`--vp-c-text-1`, `--vp-c-divider`, etc.) so it works in both light and dark mode automatically
    - Uses Tailwind utility classes for layout (with arbitrary value syntax for CSS variables)
    - `highlight` prop on segments makes dots use brand color (for active/current segments)
    - Optional `link` and `linkText` props for segment-to-page navigation
    - `ring-4 ring-[var(--vp-c-bg)]` creates a "cutout" effect where the dot sits on the line
    - Max-width 640px keeps the timeline readable, not stretched across full width
    - Uses `border-s-2` (logical start border) for the vertical line

    **Register component globally:**

    Read existing `docs/.vitepress/theme/index.ts` (created in Phase 1). Update it to import and register Timeline as a global component:

    ```typescript
    import type { Theme } from 'vitepress'
    import DefaultTheme from 'vitepress/theme'
    import Timeline from './components/Timeline.vue'
    import './style.css'

    export default {
      extends: DefaultTheme,
      enhanceApp({ app }) {
        app.component('Timeline', Timeline)
      }
    } satisfies Theme
    ```

    IMPORTANT: The existing file already has `import './style.css'` and `extends: DefaultTheme`. Preserve those. Only ADD the Timeline import and the `enhanceApp` method.

    Do NOT:
    - Use `<script setup>` import in markdown -- use global registration instead (cleaner, reusable)
    - Use hardcoded colors like `bg-blue-600` -- use VitePress CSS variables for theme compatibility
    - Add external dependencies -- pure Vue + Tailwind is sufficient
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `npm run docs:build` and confirm it completes without errors.
    Verify `docs/.vitepress/theme/components/Timeline.vue` exists and contains `defineProps`.
    Verify `docs/.vitepress/theme/index.ts` imports Timeline and registers it via `app.component`.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Timeline.vue component exists with typed props (time, title, description, link, linkText, highlight). Component uses VitePress CSS variables for dark/light mode. Component is registered globally in the theme so it can be used in any markdown file as `<Timeline />`.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Write agenda page with timeline segments</name>
  <files>
    docs/agenda.md
  </files>
  <action>
    Replace the placeholder `docs/agenda.md` with the complete agenda page using the Timeline component.

    **Page structure:**

    # Agenda

    Brief intro: "The AI-Teachathon runs on **February 17, 2026** from **17:00 to approximately 20:00**. Here's what the evening looks like."

    A short note about the informal nature: "Times are approximate — this is an interactive session, not a rigid schedule. Feel free to ask questions at any point."

    <Timeline :segments="[
      {
        time: '~17:00 – 17:15',
        title: 'Welcome & Setup Check',
        description: 'Quick introductions and a final check that everyone has their tools ready. If you haven\'t completed the setup guide yet, we\'ll help you get sorted.',

        highlight: true

        description: 'Recap what you\'ve learned, share your work, and discuss how to keep going after the event.'
      }
    ]" />

    ## Segments at a Glance

    Below the timeline, add a brief markdown section that gives a quick text summary. This helps with search indexing and accessibility:

    | Time | What |
    |------|------|
    | 17:00 | Welcome & Setup Check |
    | 17:15 | Presentation |
    | 17:45 | AI Tool Landscape |
    | 18:05 | Break |
    | 18:15 | Hands-On Session |
    | 19:45 | Wrap-Up |

    End with: "Bring your laptop with the [setup guide](/setup) completed, and you're good to go!"
    ```

    **Segment content rules (LOCKED decisions):**
    - Approximate time ranges with "~" prefix to signal flexibility
    - Title + one-liner per segment: concise, not verbose
    - No hard breaks: the event is open and informal
    - Links from segments to relevant pages (AGND-03): setup, ai-tools, hands-on
    - Highlight key segments (welcome, presentation, hands-on) with brand-colored dots

    **Segment details (from AGND-02):**
    - Welcome/Setup Check (~17:00-17:15): Links to /setup
    - Presentation (~17:15-17:45): Why AI & version control. No link yet (presentation page is Phase 3)
    - AI Tool Landscape (~17:45-18:05): Links to /ai-tools
    - Break (~18:05-18:15): No link
    - Hands-On (~18:15-19:45): Links to /hands-on
    - Wrap-Up (~19:45-20:00): No link

    **Content voice:**
    - Casual and inviting: "Grab a drink, stretch, chat with your neighbors."
    - Encouraging: "If you haven't completed the setup guide yet, we'll help you get sorted."
    - No research analogies

    Do NOT:
    - Use rigid time slots (e.g., "17:00-17:15 sharp") -- use "~17:00 – 17:15"
    - Link to the presentation page (it doesn't exist yet -- Phase 3)
    - Add speaker names or bios -- this is an informal lab event
    - Use `<script setup>` import -- Timeline is registered globally

    Run `npm run docs:build` and confirm it completes without errors.
    Run `npm run docs:dev` and navigate to the agenda page. Confirm the vertical timeline renders with dots, connecting line, time labels, titles, descriptions, and links.
    Verify `docs/agenda.md` contains: Timeline component usage, 6 segments, links to /setup, /ai-tools, and /hands-on.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Agenda page shows a polished vertical timeline with 6 segments covering the event from ~17:00 to ~20:00. Each segment has approximate time, title, and one-liner description. Relevant segments link to /setup, /ai-tools, and /hands-on. Timeline communicates relaxed, informal flow. A summary table provides accessible text fallback. All three AGND requirements are satisfied.
