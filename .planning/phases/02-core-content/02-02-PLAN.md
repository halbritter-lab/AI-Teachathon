<objective>
Write the complete setup guide with platform-specific installation instructions for VS Code, Git, GitHub account, and optional Node.js. Include verification steps with expected command outputs and a completion checklist.

Purpose: The setup guide is the most time-sensitive page -- participants need it before the event to prepare their laptops. It must be self-service: clear enough that someone with no coding experience can follow it alone.
Output: A complete, production-ready setup.md with all 5 SETUP requirements satisfied.

    Replace the placeholder `docs/setup.md` with the complete setup guide. Follow the "link-and-verify" pattern from research: link to official installer, then a verify command with expected output.

    # Setup Guide

    Brief intro paragraph: What you'll install and how long it takes (~15-20 minutes). Friendly tone: "You'll need a few tools ready before the workshop. Don't worry - everything here is free and takes about 15 minutes."

    ::: info Before You Start
    You'll need administrator access on your computer to install some of these tools. If you're using a work laptop with restrictions, ask your IT department for help.
    :::

    ## 1. VS Code (SETUP-01)

    Brief: what it is (code editor), why we use it (AI assistant support, extensions).

    Download from [code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - pick your operating system and run the installer.

    ### Recommended Extensions
    After installing, open VS Code and install these extensions (click the Extensions icon in the sidebar or press Ctrl+Shift+X / Cmd+Shift+X):
    - **GitHub Copilot** - AI code suggestions (free with GitHub Education Pack)
    - **Markdown Preview Enhanced** - for viewing .md files

    **Verify:** Open VS Code. If you see the Welcome tab, you're good.

    ## 2. Git (SETUP-02)

    Brief: what it is (version control - tracks changes to your files so you can undo mistakes and collaborate).

    ### Windows
    Download from [git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and run the installer. Use default options.

    ### macOS
    Open Terminal and run:
    ```bash
    xcode-select --install
    ```
    This installs Git along with other developer tools. Alternatively, install via Homebrew: `brew install git`

    ### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
    Open a terminal and run:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git
    ```

    ### Configure Git (all platforms)
    Open a terminal (or Git Bash on Windows) and run:
    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
    ```
    Replace with your actual name and the email you'll use for GitHub.

    ## 3. GitHub Account (SETUP-03)

    Brief: what it is (where code lives online - like Google Drive for code, but with collaboration features).

    1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and click "Sign up"
    2. Use your university email if you have one
    3. Complete the signup process

    ### GitHub Education Pack (recommended)
    If you have a university email (.edu or institutional), you can get free access to GitHub Copilot and other tools:
    - Visit [education.github.com/pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
    - Sign up with your university email
    - This gives you **free GitHub Copilot** access (normally $10/month)

    ## 4. Node.js (Optional) (SETUP-04)

    Brief: only needed if you want to use Claude Code (an AI coding tool) during the hands-on session. Most participants won't need this.

    ::: tip Optional
    Node.js is only needed if you want to try Claude Code during the workshop. You can skip this if you're not sure.
    :::

    Download the LTS version from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and run the installer.

    ## 5. Verification Checklist (SETUP-05)

    Use a VitePress info container and a markdown table:

    "Let's make sure everything is working. Open a terminal (Terminal app on macOS/Linux, Git Bash or Command Prompt on Windows) and run each command:"

    | Command | Expected Output |
    |---------|----------------|
    | `git --version` | `git version 2.x.x` (any 2.x version) |
    | `code --version` | A version number like `1.x.x` |
    | `node --version` | `v20.x.x` or higher (only if you installed Node.js) |

    ## Ready to Go!

    Final completion checklist using markdown checkboxes:

    - [ ] VS Code installed and opens
    - [ ] Git installed and `git --version` works
    - [ ] Git configured with your name and email
    - [ ] GitHub account created
    - [ ] (Optional) GitHub Education Pack applied for Copilot access
    - [ ] (Optional) Node.js installed

    End with: "If everything checks out, you're all set for the workshop! If you run into any issues, don't worry - we'll have time at the start of the event to help with setup."
    ```

    **Content voice rules (LOCKED decisions):**
    - Friendly and casual: "Don't worry if this seems confusing"
    - No research analogies: Explain Git directly, don't compare to lab notebooks
    - Link-and-verify: Official download link -> verify command. No screenshot-level detail.
    - All platforms visible with headings: Windows, macOS, Linux under H3 headings. No tabs.
    - Clean path only: No troubleshooting sections. "If stuck, ask at the event."
    - Brief inline jargon definitions on first use: "Git (a version control system that tracks changes to your files)"

    **Formatting:**
    - Use VitePress containers (`::: info`, `::: tip`, `::: warning`) for callouts
    - Use code blocks with `bash` language tag for terminal commands
    - Use markdown tables for verification output
    - Use markdown checkboxes for the completion checklist
    - Keep headings scannable: numbered sections (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

    Do NOT:
    - Add troubleshooting sections (context: "clean path only")
    - Add screenshots or images (context: "minimal hand-holding")
    - Use tabs for platform-specific content (context: "all platforms visible with headings")
    - Over-explain -- trust the reader's intelligence
    - Add sidebar configuration -- it's already set up in Phase 1
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `npm run docs:build` and confirm it completes without errors.
    Verify `docs/setup.md` contains:
    - "VS Code" or "Visual Studio Code" with download link
    - "Windows", "macOS", "Linux" headings under Git section
    - "git config" commands
    - "github.com" link and "education.github.com/pack" link
    - "Node.js" section marked as optional
    - Verification table with `git --version` and `code --version`
    - Completion checklist with checkboxes at the end
  </verify>
  <done>
    Setup guide satisfies all 5 SETUP requirements:
    - SETUP-01: VS Code installation with download link and recommended extensions
    - SETUP-02: Git installation for Windows, macOS, Linux with git config commands
    - SETUP-03: GitHub account creation with education pack link for free Copilot
    - SETUP-04: Optional Node.js installation section
    - SETUP-05: Verification checklist with commands and expected outputs, plus completion checklist
    Content tone is friendly, casual, and direct. No troubleshooting. No tabs.
  </done>
