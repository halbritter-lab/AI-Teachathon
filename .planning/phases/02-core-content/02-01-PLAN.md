<objective>
Rewrite the landing page (index.md) with full event information, three prominent CTA cards, a "What to Expect" section, and CeRKiD/Charite/Halbritter Lab footer branding.

Purpose: The landing page is the first thing participants see. It must immediately communicate when, where, and what -- then direct them to prepare (setup), see the schedule (agenda), or explore ideas.
Output: A complete landing page using VitePress's built-in home layout with customized styling for prominent CTA cards.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Rewrite landing page with event info, CTAs, and What to Expect</name>
  <files>
    docs/index.md
  </files>
  <action>
    Replace the placeholder `docs/index.md` with the full landing page content. Use VitePress's built-in `layout: home` with hero and features frontmatter.

    **Hero section:**
    ```markdown
    ---
    layout: home

    hero:
      name: AI-Teachathon
      text: Learn AI-Assisted Development
      tagline: February 17, 2026 · 17:00 · Charite Campus Berlin
      actions:
        - theme: brand
          text: Prepare Your Setup
          link: /setup
        - theme: alt
          text: View Agenda
          link: /agenda

    features:
      - icon: 🚀
        title: Prepare Your Setup
        details: Install VS Code, Git, and create a GitHub account before the event. Takes about 15 minutes.
        link: /setup
        linkText: Start setup
      - icon: 📅
        title: See the Agenda
        details: Check the timeline for the evening - from intro talk to hands-on coding session.
        link: /agenda
        linkText: View schedule
      - icon: 💡
        title: Explore Project Ideas
        details: Browse starter project ideas for the hands-on session, including KidneyQuest.
        link: /ideas
        linkText: See ideas
    ---
    ```

    IMPORTANT context decisions (LOCKED):
    - Event info first in hero: big date/time/location up top in the tagline field
    - Three CTAs as feature cards: VitePress features support icon, title, details, link, and linkText
    - Minimal visuals: text and emoji icons only. No hero images or illustrations.
    - Use emoji icons (not SVG library) to avoid adding a dependency just for 3 icons. The emojis render well in VitePress features. This is Claude's discretion per context.

    **"What to Expect" section** (markdown content below the frontmatter closing `---`):
    Write a brief section with a heading "## What to Expect" followed by 3-4 short paragraphs covering:
    - This is a hands-on, informal evening session (not a lecture)
    - No prior coding or AI experience is required -- you'll learn by doing
    - Bring your laptop with the setup guide completed beforehand
    - You'll walk away with practical skills in Git, GitHub, and AI coding tools

    Keep the tone friendly and casual per context: "like a colleague explaining over coffee." Use "you" and contractions. No research analogies per locked decision.

    Example tone: "Don't worry if you've never written a line of code. We'll start from scratch and you'll have AI helping you every step of the way."

    **Footer branding** (LAND-03):
    The footer is already configured in `docs/.vitepress/config.mts` from Phase 1 with "Halbritter Lab · CeRKiD · Charite Berlin". Verify this exists. If the footer message does NOT include all three entities (Halbritter Lab, CeRKiD, Charite), update `config.mts` to include them. But do NOT modify config.mts unless the footer is wrong -- Phase 1 already set this up.

    Do NOT:
    - Add `sidebar: false` to frontmatter -- `layout: home` automatically hides sidebar
    - Install any icon library -- emoji icons are sufficient for 3 cards
    - Add a hero image -- context says "minimal visuals, text and icons only"
    - Use research analogies -- context explicitly says "no research analogies"
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `npm run docs:build` and confirm it completes without errors.
    Run `npm run docs:dev` briefly and open the local URL to confirm the landing page renders with hero, CTA cards, and What to Expect section.
    Verify `docs/index.md` contains: layout: home, three features with links to /setup, /agenda, /ideas, and a "What to Expect" section.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Landing page shows event name, date (Feb 17, 2026), time (17:00), and location (Charite Campus Berlin) in the hero. Three CTA feature cards link to /setup, /agenda, and /ideas with icons, titles, and descriptions. "What to Expect" section appears below with friendly, casual content. Footer shows CeRKiD / Charite / Halbritter Lab branding.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add CSS overrides for prominent feature cards</name>
  <files>
    docs/.vitepress/theme/style.css
  </files>
  <action>
    Read the existing `docs/.vitepress/theme/style.css` (created in Phase 1). Append CSS overrides AFTER the existing dark theme variables to make the VitePress feature cards more prominent and card-like per the context decision "three CTAs as large button cards."

    Add these overrides at the end of the file (do NOT remove any existing content):

    ```css
    /* === Home Page: Prominent CTA Feature Cards === */
    .VPFeatures .VPFeature {
      border: 1px solid var(--vp-c-divider);
      border-radius: 12px;
      transition: border-color 0.25s, box-shadow 0.25s;
    }

    .VPFeatures .VPFeature:hover {
      border-color: var(--vp-c-brand-1);
      box-shadow: 0 2px 12px rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.15);
    }

    .dark .VPFeatures .VPFeature:hover {
      box-shadow: 0 2px 12px rgba(167, 139, 250, 0.15);
    }

    .VPFeatures .icon {
      font-size: 2rem;
    }

    .VPFeatures .title {
      font-size: 1.1rem;
      font-weight: 600;
    }

    .VPFeatures .details {
      font-size: 0.95rem;
    }

    .VPFeature .link-text {
      color: var(--vp-c-brand-1);
      font-weight: 500;
    }
    ```

    These overrides:
    - Add visible card borders with rounded corners
    - Add hover effect with brand-colored border and subtle shadow
    - Increase icon size for prominence
    - Style the link text in brand color
    - Work in both light and dark mode

    Keep changes minimal. Only override card appearance, not layout or spacing. VitePress handles the responsive grid automatically.

    Do NOT:
    - Remove or modify existing CSS variables or Tailwind imports
    - Override the VitePress grid layout (it's already responsive 3-column)
    - Add complex animations -- subtle hover is enough
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `npm run docs:build` and confirm it completes without errors.
    Visually confirm (via dev server) that feature cards have visible borders, hover effects, and larger icons.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Feature cards on the landing page appear as prominent, bordered cards with hover effects. Icons are visually larger. Cards feel like clickable buttons/cards rather than plain text blocks.
