<objective>
Add learning objectives bookends, engagement moments, and rewrite all slide titles as takeaway
statements.

Purpose: The restructured deck from Plan 01 has the right content and structure, but lacks
educational framing (no objectives or recap), audience interaction (zero engagement prompts),
and effective titles (most slides use topic labels instead of takeaway statements). This plan
adds the three remaining requirement groups to complete Phase 6.

Output: The final Phase 6 slides.md with learning objectives at start/end, 3+ engagement
prompts in speaker notes, 1+ dedicated question slide, and all titles rewritten as takeaways.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add learning objectives and recap slides</name>
  <files>docs/presentation/slides.md</files>
  <action>
Add two new slides to bookend the presentation content.

1. **Add "What You'll Learn Today" slide (OBJ-01):**
   Insert immediately AFTER the title slide (after the first `---` following the frontmatter
   and title content) and BEFORE the "We've All Been Here" slide. This is the second slide
   in the deck.

   ```markdown
   ---

   # What You'll Learn Today

   By the end of this session, you'll be able to:

   - **Understand** Git basics: repos, commits, branches, and PRs
   - **Protect** your research: .gitignore, private repos, and PII management
   - **Explain** why version control is essential when using AI tools
   - **Navigate** the AI tool landscape and choose what fits your workflow
   - **Follow** the complete Git workflow hands-on with KidneyQuest

   <!-- This primes the audience for what matters. Keep to 5 objectives max. Use action verbs. Revisit these at the end to close the loop. -->
   ```

2. **Add "What You Now Know" recap slide (OBJ-02):**
   Insert immediately BEFORE the final closing slide ("Let's Get Started!"). This creates the
   bookend with the objectives slide.

   ```markdown
   ---

   # What You Now Know

   You've learned:
   - **Git** tracks every change safely - repos, commits, branches
   - **Branches and PRs** let you experiment and collaborate without risk
   - **.gitignore and private repos** protect sensitive research data
   - **AI + version control** = safe, fast iteration
   - **The workflow:** clone, branch, code with AI, PR, merge

   **Next up:** Apply all of this hands-on with KidneyQuest

   <!-- Bridge between theory and practice. Reinforce key takeaways. Point back to the objectives from the beginning - they've now covered each one. -->
   ```

Do NOT modify any existing slides in this task. Only add these two new slides.

  <name>Task 2: Add engagement prompts and question slide</name>
  <files>docs/presentation/slides.md</files>
  <action>
Add engagement moments throughout the deck and one dedicated question slide.

1. **Add engagement prompts to speaker notes (ENG-01):**
   Add `ENGAGEMENT:` prefixed prompts to at least 4 existing slides' speaker notes. Insert these
   at the BEGINNING of the existing speaker note comment, keeping existing note content after.
   Target slides spaced roughly 5-7 minutes apart across the 30-minute presentation.

   **Prompt 1 - "We've All Been Here" slide (early, ~minute 2):**
   Add to the beginning of the existing speaker note:
   `ENGAGEMENT: Show of hands - who has more than 5 versions of a file right now? [Pause for laughter/recognition] `

   **Prompt 2 - "Git vs GitHub" slide or equivalent (mid Part 1, ~minute 8):**
   Add to the beginning of the existing speaker note:
   `ENGAGEMENT: Quick check - "If your laptop dies right now, is your Git history lost? What about your GitHub repos?" [Pause for 2-3 responses. Answer: Git is local (lost if not pushed), GitHub is remote (safe).] `

   **Prompt 3 - The AI timeline or "AI generates code fast" slide (Part 2, ~minute 15):**
   Add to the beginning of the existing speaker note:
   `ENGAGEMENT: Show of hands - who has used ChatGPT, Copilot, or any AI coding tool before? [Gauge the room's experience level. Adjust depth accordingly.] `

   **Prompt 4 - "The Workflow You'll Follow" or KidneyQuest slide (Part 4, ~minute 25):**
   Add to the beginning of the existing speaker note:
   `ENGAGEMENT: Turn to your neighbor - which step do you think will be the hardest? [30 seconds. Then ask 1-2 pairs to share. Common answer: Step 3 or Step 5.] `

   Format: Keep engagement text on the same line inside the existing `<!-- -->` comment.
   Prepend the ENGAGEMENT text, then the original speaker note after a space.

2. **Add dedicated question slide (ENG-02):**
   Insert a question slide in Part 1 AFTER the PII management slide ("Never Commit Patient Data
   or Credentials") and BEFORE the branches slide. This position follows the safety content
   cluster and tests comprehension before moving to collaboration concepts.

   ```markdown
   ---

   <!-- _class: lead -->

   # If you accidentally commit a password to GitHub, can you just delete the file?

   <!-- Give 10 seconds of silence. Then explain: No - it's in the history forever. Even if you delete the file in a new commit, the old commit still has it. This is why .gitignore and reviewing diffs matters. Prevention is everything. This reinforces the previous 3 slides. -->
   ```

   This uses `_class: lead` for large centered text, which is the established pattern for
   emphasis slides in this deck.
  </action>
  <verify>
Count engagement prompts: grep for "ENGAGEMENT:" in slides.md - should return at least 4 matches.
Verify engagement variety: grep output should show "Show of hands" (at least 2), "Quick check" (1), and "Turn to your neighbor" (1).
Verify question slide: grep for "accidentally commit a password" - should return 1 match.
Verify question slide uses lead class: the slide should have `_class: lead` directive.
Run `npx marp --input "docs/presentation/slides.md" --html --allow-local-files -o /dev/null 2>&1 || echo "Marp check done"`.
  </verify>
  <done>
At least 4 engagement prompts added to speaker notes across the deck (show of hands, quick check,
pair discussion). One dedicated question slide with large text added after PII content.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Rewrite slide titles as takeaway statements</name>
  <files>docs/presentation/slides.md</files>
  <action>
Rewrite content slide titles from topic labels to takeaway statements (TITL-01). Section break
slides (Part 1, Part 2, etc.) and the title slide keep their current format - only content
slides get takeaway titles.

Apply these specific transformations. The research file provides verified examples. For each
slide, change ONLY the `# Title` line. Do NOT modify slide content or speaker notes.

**Title transformations (use these exact titles):**

| Current Title | New Takeaway Title |

| There's a Better Way | Version Control Unlocks AI's Potential |
| Real Consequences | Reproducibility Requires Version Control |

**Notes:**
- "We've All Been Here" stays as-is (it's already a relatable statement, not a topic label)
- "Experiment Freely, Fail Safely" stays as-is (already a takeaway)
- "Private Repos Protect Unpublished Research" stays as-is (already a takeaway)
- "Never Commit Patient Data or Credentials" stays as-is (already a takeaway)
- Keep all titles under 60 characters where possible
- Do NOT change section break titles (Part 1, Part 2, etc.)
- Do NOT change the title slide, "What You'll Learn Today", "What You Now Know", "Let's Get Started", or the question slide

- "# Branches: Parallel Experiments" - should be 0 matches
- "# AI Generates Code Fast" - should be 0 matches
