<objective>
Restructure the Marp presentation and add 5 essential researcher content slides.

Purpose: The current 32-slide deck has structural issues (single-slide Part 3 section, sparse
hands-on steps, tool slides out of order) and is missing critical content for medical researchers
(private repos, .gitignore, PII management, conventional commits, semantic versioning). This plan
fixes the skeleton so that Plan 02 can add polish (objectives, engagement, titles) on a stable
foundation.

Output: A restructured slides.md with ~35 slides, 4 parts instead of 5, 5 new content slides,
combined Steps 1-2, expanded Step 3, and reordered tool section.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Restructure sections and reorder tool slides</name>
  <files>docs/presentation/slides.md</files>
  <action>
Modify the existing slides.md to perform these structural changes. Preserve ALL existing content
and speaker notes - only move, merge, or reorganize slides. Keep the Marp frontmatter unchanged.

1. **Merge Part 3 into Part 2 (STRC-01):**
   - Remove the Part 3 section break slide (`<!-- _class: lead --> # Part 3: The AI Revolution Timeline`)
   - Rename the Part 2 section break from "Part 2: Why Version Control Matters with AI" to
     "Part 2: Version Control in the AI Era"
   - The "2022-2026: Rapid Acceleration" slide stays where it is, now under Part 2 (after the
     "Experiment Freely, Fail Safely" slide)
   - Result: Part 2 now has 3 content slides (AI Generates Code Fast, Experiment Freely, AI Timeline)

2. **Renumber remaining parts:**
   - Old Part 4 (Tool Landscape) becomes Part 3
   - Old Part 5 (What We'll Do Today) becomes Part 4

3. **Move "Choose Your Tool" before category slides (STRC-04):**
   - Currently "Choose Your Tool" appears AFTER the 3 category slides (Chat, IDE, CLI)
   - Move it to appear directly after "The Spectrum of AI Coding Tools" overview slide
   - New order in Part 3: Spectrum overview -> Choose Your Tool -> Chat-Based -> IDE Sidebar ->
     CLI Agents -> Where to Learn More
   - Update "Choose Your Tool" speaker note to reference that details follow:
     `<!-- The goal is to learn the workflow, not master a specific tool. Pick what works for you. We'll briefly cover each category next. -->`

4. **Combine Steps 1-2 into single slide (STRC-02):**
   - Replace the separate "Step 1: Clone the Repo" and "Step 2: Create a Branch" slides with one
     combined slide:
     ```
     # Steps 1-2: Clone the Repo and Create a Branch

     **Clone the repository:**
     `git clone https://github.com/berntpopp/KidneyQuest.git`

     **Create your branch:**
     `git checkout -b add-new-gene`

     Now you have the code and your own safe workspace. Main is untouched.

     <!-- Two quick commands, paired together. We'll walk through this together. No one gets left behind. -->
     ```

5. **Expand Step 3 with example prompt and output (STRC-03):**
   - Replace the current sparse Step 3 slide with an expanded version:
     ```
     # Step 3: Code with AI

     **Example prompt to your AI tool:**
     > "Add a scoreboard to KidneyQuest that displays the number of genes collected"

     **What the AI might generate:**
     - HTML for the scoreboard element
     - JavaScript to track and update the score
     - CSS for positioning and styling

     **Your job:** Review the code, test in the browser, iterate

     **You are the pilot. AI is the copilot.**

     <!-- This is the most important step. Show a concrete example so they see what AI-assisted coding looks like. AI will make mistakes - that's normal. Review, test, iterate. -->
     ```

Do NOT change slide titles yet (that is Plan 02, TITL-01). Keep existing titles as-is for now.
Do NOT add engagement prompts yet (that is Plan 02, ENG-01/ENG-02).
Do NOT add learning objectives slides yet (that is Plan 02, OBJ-01/OBJ-02).

Run `npx marp --input "docs/presentation/slides.md" --html --allow-local-files -o /dev/null 2>&1 || echo "Marp check done"` from the project root to verify Marp can parse the file without errors.
Count the section break slides (grep for `_class: lead`) - should be exactly 4 section breaks (Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4) plus the title and closing slides.
Verify Part 3 section break does NOT exist by grepping for "AI Revolution Timeline" - should return no matches.
Verify "Choose Your Tool" appears before "Chat-Based Tools" by checking line numbers.
Verify "Steps 1-2" combined slide exists and separate Step 1/Step 2 slides are gone.
  </verify>
  <done>
Part 3 (AI Timeline) merged into Part 2. Parts renumbered to 4 total. Choose Your Tool moved before
category details. Steps 1-2 combined. Step 3 expanded with example prompt. File parses with Marp.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add 5 essential researcher content slides</name>
  <files>docs/presentation/slides.md</files>
  <action>
Add 5 new content slides to Part 1 (Git Basics section). Insert them AFTER the commit messages
slide ("Why Commit Messages Matter") and BEFORE the branches slide ("Branches: Parallel
Experiments"). This placement groups all "working with Git" fundamentals together before
moving to collaboration concepts (branches, PRs).

The research file has verified content for each slide. Use these exact slides:

**Slide 1 - Conventional Commits (CONT-04):**
Place immediately after the commit messages slide since it directly extends that topic.
```markdown
---

# Conventional Commits: Structured Messages

**Format:** `type(scope): description`

**Common types:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation
- `refactor:` - Code restructure
- `test:` - Tests

**Example:** `feat: add gene search filter`

<!-- This builds on the previous slide. KidneyQuest uses this format. It enables automated changelogs and clear history. Show a real example from the repo's git log if possible. -->
```

**Slide 2 - Semantic Versioning (CONT-05):**
Place after conventional commits since version bumps are triggered by commit types.
```markdown
---

# Semantic Versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

**v1.2.3 means:**
- **1** (MAJOR) - Breaking changes
- **2** (MINOR) - New features, backward compatible
- **3** (PATCH) - Bug fixes

**Why researchers care:** Reproducibility
- Cite specific versions in papers
- Know when updates break things

<!-- Bumping from v1.x to v2.0 means "this may break your analysis." Link back to conventional commits: feat bumps MINOR, fix bumps PATCH. -->
```

**Slide 3 - Private Repos (CONT-01):**
Place after semantic versioning, starting the "safety" cluster.
```markdown
---

# Private Repos Protect Unpublished Research

**Public repositories:**
- Anyone can view, clone, and contribute
- Good for: Open source, teaching, published tools

**Private repositories:**
- Restricted access only
- Good for: Unpublished research, patient-adjacent data, pre-publication code

**Default for medical research:** Start private, make public when ready

<!-- Charite context: most research should be private until publication. GitHub gives you unlimited private repos for free. -->
```

**Slide 4 - .gitignore (CONT-02):**
Place after private repos, continuing the safety theme.
```markdown
---

# .gitignore: Your First Defense Against Data Leaks

**What it is:** A file telling Git which files to never track

**What to ignore:**
- Large data (CSVs, FASTQs, imaging)
- Environment files (.env, API keys)
- Binary files (PDFs, compiled code)
- OS artifacts (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db)

**Why it matters:** Prevents accidental commits of things that should never be in a repo

<!-- .gitignore is your first line of defense. Use GitHub's templates for your language. Prevention is easier than cleanup. -->
```

**Slide 5 - PII Management (CONT-03):**
Place after .gitignore, completing the safety cluster.
```markdown
---

# Never Commit Patient Data or Credentials

**The rules:**
- No patient data, even "anonymized"
- No API keys, passwords, or tokens
- No institutional credentials

**What if you do?** It's in the history forever. Rewriting history is painful.

**Best practice:** Always review diffs before committing

<!-- For medical research, this is non-negotiable. Prevention is everything. A single accidental commit of patient data can be a serious compliance issue. -->
```

After inserting these 5 slides, the Part 1 section should flow:
Repository -> Commits -> Commit Messages -> Conventional Commits -> Semantic Versioning ->
Private Repos -> .gitignore -> PII -> Branches -> Pull Requests -> Git vs GitHub

Ensure each new slide has proper `---` separators and speaker notes in `<!-- -->` comments.
Do NOT modify any of the existing slides beyond what Task 1 already changed.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx marp --input "docs/presentation/slides.md" --html --allow-local-files -o /dev/null 2>&1 || echo "Marp check done"` to verify Marp parsing.
Grep for each new slide title to confirm all 5 exist:
- "Conventional Commits" - should match
- "Semantic Versioning" - should match
- "Private Repos Protect" - should match
- ".gitignore" - should match
- "Never Commit Patient Data" - should match
Count total slides (grep for `^---$` in slides.md, subtract 1 for frontmatter) - should be approximately 35-37.
  </verify>
  <done>
Five new content slides added to Part 1 in the correct order. Each has appropriate content for
non-technical medical researchers, speaker notes, and proper Marp formatting. Total slide count
increased by approximately 4 (5 added, 1 removed from Steps 1-2 merge).
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

After both tasks complete:
1. Run `make build-marp` to verify the presentation builds without errors
2. Verify Part 3 (AI Timeline) section break is gone: `grep -c "AI Revolution Timeline" docs/presentation/slides.md` returns 0
3. Verify all 5 new topics exist: grep for "Conventional Commits", "Semantic Versioning", "Private Repos", ".gitignore", "Patient Data"
4. Verify Part numbering: grep for "Part 1:", "Part 2:", "Part 3:", "Part 4:" - should be exactly these 4
5. Verify "Choose Your Tool" appears before "Chat-Based Tools" in the file
6. Verify Steps 1-2 are combined: grep for "Steps 1-2" returns 1 match, grep for "Step 1: Clone" returns 0
7. Verify Step 3 has example prompt: grep for "scoreboard" in slides.md returns a match
