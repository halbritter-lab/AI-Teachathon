<objective>
Write the complete hands-on coding guide (docs/hands-on.md), replacing the current placeholder with a two-phase workshop guide covering the full Git workflow with AI assistance, troubleshooting, prompting tips, and KidneyQuest framing.

Purpose: This page is the centerpiece of the 90-minute hands-on session (18:15-19:45). Participants follow it on their laptops while coding. It must be self-service — clear enough that participants can work at their own pace while instructors float around.

Output: A complete, publication-ready docs/hands-on.md with step-by-step instructions, copy-paste commands, troubleshooting, and AI prompt examples.

# Hands-On Guide

Intro paragraph (3-4 sentences): This is the main event. You'll work through a real coding workflow using Git, GitHub, and AI tools. There are two phases — first we'll practice together, then you'll work on your own project. Work at your own pace; instructors are here to help.

::: info Before You Start
Make sure you've completed the [setup guide](/setup). You'll need VS Code, Git, and a GitHub account ready to go.
:::

## How This Session Works

Brief explanation of the two-phase approach:
- **Phase 1: Follow Along** — Everyone works on the AI-Teachathon repository together. This teaches the Git workflow in a safe, familiar environment (you've already seen this website).
- **Phase 2: On Your Own** — Graduate to KidneyQuest or your own project. Same workflow, new challenge.

## Phase 1: Follow Along

"We'll start with this website's repository — the one you've been reading. You'll fork it, make a small change, and submit a pull request. This is the exact workflow used by developers and researchers worldwide."

Write steps 1-8 of the Git workflow. Each step follows this exact pattern from the research:

### Step N: [Action Name]

[1-2 sentence context: what this does and why]

```bash
# Command to copy-paste
command --flags
```

[1 sentence explaining what the command does]

**Verify it worked:**
```bash
verification-command
```
[Expected output]

::: details If something went wrong
**Problem:** [specific error]
**Solution:** [concrete fix]
:::

[Transition sentence to next step]

The 8 steps for Phase 1:

Step 1: Fork the Repository
- Go to github.com/berntpopp/AI-Teachathon, click "Fork" button
- This creates your own copy on GitHub
- Troubleshoot: Can't find Fork button (not signed in)

Step 2: Clone Your Fork
- git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/AI-Teachathon.git
- cd AI-Teachathon
- Platform note: commands identical but Windows users use Git Bash or Command Prompt
- Verify: git remote -v shows your fork
- Troubleshoot: "not found" (wrong URL), authentication error (HTTPS vs SSH)

Step 3: Create a Feature Branch
- git checkout -b feature/add-your-name
- Verify: git branch shows asterisk on new branch
- Troubleshoot: "not a git repository" (wrong directory)

Step 4: Make a Change with AI Help
- Open the project in VS Code: code .
- Find a file to edit (suggest docs/ideas.md or adding a comment)
- Use your AI tool to help: provide an example prompt for this step
- Example AI prompt (in a code block): "I'm contributing to a VitePress website about an AI workshop. I want to add [my idea] to the ideas page. The file is docs/ideas.md and it uses markdown. Show me what to add."
- Note: This is where your AI tool shines — ask it to help write or improve content

Step 5: Stage Your Changes
- git add docs/ideas.md (or whatever file was changed)
- Verify: git status shows green "Changes to be committed"
- Troubleshoot: "nothing to commit" (forgot to save file in VS Code)

Step 6: Commit Your Changes
- git commit -m "Add [description of your change]"
- Explain: a commit is like a save point with a description
- Verify: git log --oneline shows your commit at the top
- Troubleshoot: "Please tell me who you are" (git config not set — link to setup guide)

Step 7: Push to GitHub
- git push origin feature/add-your-name
- Explain: this sends your local changes to your fork on GitHub
- Verify: visit your fork on GitHub, see the new branch
- Troubleshoot: "rejected" (try git pull first), authentication (use HTTPS token or GitHub CLI)

Step 8: Open a Pull Request
- Go to your fork on GitHub, click "Compare & pull request"
- Add a title and brief description
- Click "Create pull request"
- Explain: a pull request asks the original project to review and accept your changes
- Troubleshoot: "No changes" (pushed to wrong branch), can't find the button (check you're on the right branch)

After Phase 1, add a congratulations callout:
::: tip Congratulations!
You've just completed a full Git workflow — the same process used by millions of developers every day. Fork, clone, branch, edit, commit, push, PR. That's the whole cycle.
:::

CRITICAL: Do NOT use emojis. Use VitePress ::: details containers for all troubleshooting. Match the friendly tone from setup.md. Every command must be in a fenced code block with bash syntax highlighting.
  </action>
  <verify>Check that docs/hands-on.md contains all 8 steps with commands, verify steps, and troubleshooting details containers. Count the ::: details blocks (should be at least 8).</verify>
  <done>Phase 1 section is complete with 8 Git workflow steps, each having copy-paste commands, verification, and collapsible troubleshooting.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Write Phase 2 (On Your Own), prompting guide, and KidneyQuest framing</name>
  <files>docs/hands-on.md</files>
  <action>
Continue docs/hands-on.md after Phase 1. Add three remaining sections:

## Phase 2: On Your Own

"Now that you know the workflow, it's time to tackle a real project. You have two options:"

### Option A: KidneyQuest

Brief KidneyQuest introduction (keep it minimal per user decision):
- KidneyQuest is a browser game starring the CeRKiD zebra
- CeRKiD = Center for Rare Kidney Diseases at Charite (the Halbritter Lab); the zebra is the rare disease mascot
- Think Chrome's dinosaur game but with a zebra in a kidney-themed world
- Tech: vanilla HTML5 Canvas — zero dependencies, just open index.html in a browser
- "The repository will be available during the session. Your instructors will share the link and walk through the available issues."

Explain the workflow is identical to Phase 1:
1. Fork the KidneyQuest repo
2. Clone your fork
3. Pick an issue from the issue tracker
4. Create a branch, make changes with AI help, commit, push, open PR

::: info Setting Expectations
You probably won't build a complete game in 90 minutes — and that's fine. The goal is to practice the workflow (Git + AI tools) on a real project. Even adding a single feature or fixing one issue is a great outcome.
:::

### Option B: Your Own Project

Brief: "If you have your own repository or project idea, apply the same workflow. Fork or clone, branch, code with AI, commit, push, PR."

## How to Prompt AI Effectively

Intro paragraph: "Whether you're using a chatbot, Copilot, or a CLI agent, how you ask matters. Here are the key principles."

Write 4 principles (per CONTEXT.md decisions):

### 1. Be Specific About What You Want
- Bad example (in code block): "Make this better"
- Good example (in code block): "Refactor this function to validate email addresses using a regex pattern. Return true for valid emails, false otherwise."

### 2. Give Context
- Explain: Tell the AI what project you're working on, what language, what goal
- Bad: "Add a jump feature"
- Good: "I'm building KidneyQuest, a browser game using vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. It's a side-scrolling jump game like Chrome's dino game. Add a jump mechanic: spacebar press makes the zebra rise 150px over 300ms, then gravity pulls it back down. Prevent double-jumping."

### 3. Specify the Output Format
- Ask for what you need: "Return just the function" or "Explain each line with comments" or "Give me the terminal command"

### 4. Iterate on Results
- First response not quite right? Refine: "That's close, but also handle the case where..."
- AI coding is a conversation, not a single request

Then add model-specific tips:

### Tips for Claude
Reference the 4-block pattern (from official docs):
1. Context — what you're working on
2. Task — what specific thing you want
3. Constraints — limitations or requirements
4. Output format — how the result should look

Show a full example prompt for KidneyQuest in a code block.

Link: "Learn more: [Claude Prompting Best Practices](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-4-best-practices)"

### Tips for Gemini
- Keep it direct and concise — one clear sentence per instruction
- Put constraints at the beginning
- Use default settings (don't change temperature)

Show a concise example prompt for the same task.

Link: "Learn more: [Gemini Prompting Strategies](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting-strategies)"

---

## Example Prompts for Common Tasks

Provide 5-6 ready-to-use prompts in code blocks that participants can copy-adapt. Mix workflow prompts and project prompts:

1. "Understanding a codebase" — "I just cloned [repo]. Explain the project structure and what each file does."
2. "Writing a commit message" — "I changed [file] to [description]. Write a clear, concise Git commit message for this change."
3. "Fixing an error" — "I'm getting this error: [paste error]. The file is [filename] written in [language]. What's causing this and how do I fix it?"
4. "Adding a game feature" — "I'm building KidneyQuest [context]. Add [specific feature] using vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas."
5. "Writing documentation" — "I added [feature] to [project]. Write a brief description for the README explaining what it does and how to use it."
6. "Reviewing code" — "Review this code for bugs, readability, and best practices. Suggest improvements: [paste code]"

End with a final section:
