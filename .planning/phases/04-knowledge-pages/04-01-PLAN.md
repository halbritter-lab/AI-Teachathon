<objective>
Write the complete AI tool landscape overview page (docs/ai-tools.md), replacing the current placeholder with the full content covering the 4-level evolution spectrum, ~10 tool comparison cards, and 5 practical tips.

Purpose: This page supports the 20-minute "AI Tool Landscape" segment of the workshop (17:45-18:05). Participants reference it during the talk and later when choosing tools for the hands-on session.

Output: A complete, publication-ready docs/ai-tools.md with educational content that matches the site's established tone (friendly, casual, no jargon without inline definitions).

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write the AI tool evolution spectrum</name>
  <files>docs/ai-tools.md</files>
  <action>
Replace the entire placeholder content in docs/ai-tools.md with the full AI tools page. Start with an introductory paragraph (2-3 sentences, friendly tone matching setup.md), then write the 4-level evolution spectrum.

Structure the spectrum as a timeline showing how fast the field moves:

## The AI Coding Tool Spectrum

Brief intro paragraph: AI coding tools have evolved rapidly. Understanding where they came from helps you pick the right one today.

### Level 1: Chat Interfaces (2023-2024)
- Copy-paste workflow: ask chatbot, copy code, paste into editor
- Tools: ChatGPT, Claude.ai, Gemini
- Still useful for: explaining concepts, debugging errors, writing short snippets
- Limitation: manual back-and-forth, no file access

### Level 2: IDE-Integrated (2024-2025)
- AI suggestions appear directly in your editor as you type
- Tools: GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf
- Best for: autocomplete, inline suggestions, chat panel within editor
- Limitation: limited to one file at a time, can't run commands

### Level 3: CLI Agents (2025-2026)
- AI works directly in your terminal, can read/edit files, run commands
- Tools: Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Aider, Codex CLI
- Best for: multi-file changes, running tests, Git workflows
- Key advance: AI sees your whole project, not just one file

### Level 4: Autonomous Agents (Emerging)
- AI builds entire features independently, plans multi-step tasks
- Tools: Devin, plan-mode features in Claude Code/Gemini CLI, orchestration plugins (GSD)
- Still early: expensive, requires supervision, best for experienced developers
- Where it's heading: AI as a collaborator, not just an assistant

Use VitePress ::: info container for a callout after the spectrum:
"During this workshop, you'll primarily use Level 1 (chat) and Level 2 (IDE) tools. Level 3 tools are available if you want to try them - check the setup guide for Node.js installation."

Tone: Friendly, no jargon without definition. Match the voice in setup.md ("like a colleague explaining over coffee"). Do NOT use emojis anywhere on this page.
  </action>
  <verify>Check that docs/ai-tools.md contains all four spectrum levels with time periods, and the info callout linking to setup guide.</verify>
  <done>Four spectrum levels are written with time periods, tool examples, "best for" descriptions, and limitations at each level.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Write tool comparison cards and practical tips</name>
  <files>docs/ai-tools.md</files>
  <action>
Continue docs/ai-tools.md after the spectrum section. Add two major sections:

## Tool Comparison

Brief intro: "Here's a closer look at the tools you're most likely to encounter. Pricing is accurate as of February 2026."

Write ~10 tool cards using this consistent structure per tool (use H3 for each tool name):

### [Tool Name]

**Type:** [Chat / IDE / CLI / Autonomous]
**Best for:** [specific use case in 1 sentence]
**Cost:** [pricing with tiers, student discounts noted]
**What you get:** [2-3 concise bullet points]

[Recommendation tag as a VitePress ::: tip container if it's a recommended tool]

Tools to include (10 total, grouped by level):

Chat interfaces:
1. ChatGPT / GPT-4 - Chat, $0 free tier / $20 Plus / $200 Pro. Mention Codex CLI access with Plus.
2. Claude.ai - Chat, $0 free tier / $20 Pro (includes Claude Code access). Note ~45 prompts per 5hr window on Pro.
3. Gemini (Google) - Chat, free with Google account. Mention Gemini CLI access.

IDE-integrated:
4. GitHub Copilot - IDE, free tier (2k completions/mo) / $10 Pro / free for students via Education Pack. RECOMMENDED for workshop participants.
5. Cursor - IDE, free tier / $20 Pro. Note: usage-based costs can exceed subscription.
6. Windsurf - IDE, free tier / $15 Pro.

CLI agents:
7. Claude Code - CLI, available on Claude Pro plan ($20/mo). RECOMMENDED for power users.
8. Gemini CLI - CLI, free with Google account. RECOMMENDED as free option.
9. Aider - CLI, open-source, free (bring your own API key). Note: requires API key setup.
10. Codex CLI (OpenAI) - CLI, available with ChatGPT Plus ($20/mo), temporarily free tier.

Autonomous (mention briefly):
Add a short paragraph after the cards: "Autonomous tools like Devin ($20/mo) and orchestration plugins are emerging but still require developer experience. We mention them for completeness - focus on Levels 1-3 for now."

After the tool cards, add a decision guide using a ::: tip container:
"Not sure where to start? If you're a student, get GitHub Copilot (free with Education Pack). Want to try a CLI agent? Gemini CLI is free with any Google account. Already have a Claude Pro subscription? Try Claude Code."

## 5 Tips for Working with AI Coding Tools

Write 5 actionable, numbered tips. Each tip: bold title + 2-3 sentence explanation. Tips should be:

1. Start with a specific question, not "make this better"
2. Give context about your project (language, framework, what you're building)
3. Review AI output before using it (AI makes confident mistakes)
4. Iterate - if the first response isn't right, refine your prompt
5. Use AI for learning, not just output (ask it to explain its code)

End the page with a transition section:
## Ready for the Hands-On Session?

Brief paragraph pointing to the hands-on guide: "Now that you know the landscape, it's time to put these tools to work. Head to the [hands-on guide](/hands-on) to start coding."

CRITICAL: Do NOT use emojis anywhere. All pricing must include "as of February 2026" qualifier (once at section intro is sufficient). Match the tone established in setup.md.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: npm run docs:build from the project root. Verify no build errors. Count the tool cards (should be 10). Verify the 5 tips section exists. Check that no emojis appear in the file (grep for common emoji Unicode ranges).
  </verify>
  <done>
docs/ai-tools.md contains: (1) 4-level spectrum with time periods, (2) 10 tool comparison cards with consistent structure, (3) recommendation badges on key tools, (4) decision guide callout, (5) 5 practical tips, (6) transition link to hands-on guide, (7) no emojis, (8) pricing qualified with Feb 2026 date, (9) builds without errors.
