<objective>
Extend the Marp theme CSS with reusable utility classes (section colors, code readability, content density) and restyle all 4 section break slides with auto-sized fit titles, unique color identities, and title + subtitle format.

Purpose: Establishes the visual foundation that all subsequent visual work builds on - section differentiation, utility classes for split layouts and scoped styles.
Output: Updated marp-theme.css with utility classes, 4 restyled section break slides in slides.md.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Extend marp-theme.css with utility classes</name>
  <files>docs/.vitepress/theme/marp-theme.css</files>
  <action>
Add the following utility class groups to the existing marp-theme.css, AFTER the existing styles (do not modify existing styles):

**Section color themes** (4 unique gradient backgrounds, one per section):
- `.section-git` - blue-to-teal gradient: `background: linear-gradient(135deg, #0288d1 0%, #02c797 100%);`
- `.section-ai` - purple-to-teal gradient: `background: linear-gradient(135deg, #7b1fa2 0%, #02c797 100%);`
- `.section-tools` - dark GitHub gray to teal: `background: linear-gradient(135deg, #24292e 0%, #02c797 100%);`
- `.section-workflow` - orange-to-teal gradient: `background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f57c00 0%, #02c797 100%);`

For all section classes, ensure h1 text stays white:
```css
.section-git h1, .section-ai h1, .section-tools h1, .section-workflow h1 {
  color: #ffffff;
}
```

Also ensure subtitle text (paragraph immediately after h1) is white with slight transparency:
```css
.section-git p, .section-ai p, .section-tools p, .section-workflow p {
  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85);
  font-size: 1.6rem;
}
```

**Code readability utility classes:**
- `.large-code pre` - `font-size: 2.2rem; line-height: 1.5;`

**Content density utility classes:**
- `.tight-spacing li` - `margin-bottom: 0.3rem;`
- `.compact h2` - `font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;`

Keep existing CSS unchanged. Append new classes after the `pre` rule block. Add a comment separator `/* === Utility classes === */` before the new classes.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `make build-marp` to confirm the theme compiles without errors. Grep marp-theme.css for "section-git", "section-ai", "section-tools", "section-workflow", "large-code", "tight-spacing", "compact" to confirm all classes exist.
  </verify>
  <done>marp-theme.css contains 4 section color classes with unique gradients, code readability classes, and content density classes. Build succeeds.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Restyle all 4 section break slides with fit directive and section classes</name>
  <files>docs/presentation/slides.md</files>
  <action>
Update the 4 existing section break slides in slides.md. Each section break currently uses `<!-- _class: lead -->` and a simple heading. Transform each to use the fit directive, a section-specific utility class, and a subtitle.

**Section breaks to update (identified by current content):**

1. **Part 1: Git Basics** (currently around line 73-76):
   Change from:
   ```
   <!-- _class: lead -->

   # Part 1: Git Basics
   ```
   To:
   ```
   <!-- _class: lead section-git -->

   # <!-- fit --> Part 1: Git Basics

   Your foundation for version control
   ```

2. **Part 2: Version Control in the AI Era** (currently around line 255-258):
   Change from:
   ```
   <!-- _class: lead -->

   # Part 2: Version Control in the AI Era
   ```
   To:
   ```
   <!-- _class: lead section-ai -->

   # <!-- fit --> Part 2: Version Control in the AI Era

   Why Git matters more when AI writes your code
   ```

3. **Part 3: The Tool Landscape** (currently around line 302-304):
   Change from:
   ```
   <!-- _class: lead -->

   # Part 3: The Tool Landscape
   ```
   To:
   ```
   <!-- _class: lead section-tools -->

   # <!-- fit --> Part 3: The Tool Landscape

   Navigate AI coding tools with confidence
   ```

4. **Part 4: What We'll Do Today** (currently around line 397-399):
   Change from:
   ```
   <!-- _class: lead -->

   # Part 4: What We'll Do Today
   ```
   To:
   ```
   <!-- _class: lead section-workflow -->

   # <!-- fit --> Part 4: What We'll Do Today

   From clone to merge in five steps
   ```

Do NOT modify any existing speaker notes for these slides. Do NOT change the title slide or closing slide (they remain plain `lead` class). Do NOT modify any content slides - only the 4 section break slides listed above.

Also disable pagination on section break slides by adding `<!-- _paginate: false -->` before each section break's class directive (same pattern as the title slide).
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `make build-marp` to confirm the presentation builds successfully. Grep slides.md for `<!-- fit -->` - should find exactly 4 occurrences. Grep for `section-git`, `section-ai`, `section-tools`, `section-workflow` - each should appear exactly once. Verify the Marp HTML output file exists at docs/public/presentation.html.
  </verify>
  <done>All 4 section break slides use `<!-- fit -->` for auto-sized titles, each has a unique section color class, and each includes a descriptive subtitle. Pagination is disabled on section breaks. Build succeeds.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

1. `make build-marp` completes without errors
2. marp-theme.css contains 4 section color utility classes with distinct gradients
3. slides.md contains exactly 4 `<!-- fit -->` directives, all on section break slides
4. Each section break has a unique `section-*` class (git, ai, tools, workflow)
5. Each section break has a subtitle paragraph below the heading
6. No existing content slides or speaker notes were modified

<success_criteria>
- Theme CSS has reusable section color classes and utility classes for code readability and content density
- All 4 section breaks visually differentiated with unique color gradients
- All 4 section breaks use fit directive for auto-sized titles
- All 4 section breaks follow title + subtitle format
- Presentation builds successfully with `make build-marp`
