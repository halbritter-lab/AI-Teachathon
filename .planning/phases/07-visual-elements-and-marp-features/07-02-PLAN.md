<objective>
Create 3 professional SVG diagrams (git branching, 5-step workflow, AI timeline), apply Marp split layouts to content slides using these diagrams, and add scoped style blocks to slides that need per-slide adjustments.

Purpose: Adds the visual richness that transforms the presentation from text-heavy to visually engaging, using Marp's native split layout and scoped styling capabilities.
Output: 3 SVG diagrams in docs/presentation/images/diagrams/, split layouts on 3+ slides, scoped styles on 2+ slides, rebuilt presentation artifact.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create SVG diagrams in docs/presentation/images/diagrams/</name>
  <files>
    docs/presentation/images/diagrams/git-branching.svg
    docs/presentation/images/diagrams/workflow-5-step.svg
    docs/presentation/images/diagrams/ai-timeline.svg
  </files>
  <action>
Create the directory structure `docs/presentation/images/diagrams/` and create 3 SVG diagrams. All diagrams must:
- Use the project's theme colors: #02c797 (teal highlight), #04e6af (bright teal), #ffffff (white text), #c6c6c6 (dimmed/secondary), #1a1a1a (background)
- Be clean vector/SVG style - polished, minimal line art, professional and modern
- Use `viewBox` for responsive sizing (no fixed width/height attributes)
- Include embedded `<style>` block using theme colors
- Use sans-serif font family for all text

**1. git-branching.svg** (VIS-01) - Branch and merge diagram:
- viewBox="0 0 800 400"
- Show a horizontal `main` branch line with 3-4 commit dots
- A feature branch diverging upward from the 2nd commit, with 2-3 commits on the branch
- The feature branch merging back into main at the end
- Labels: "main" on the main line, "feature branch" on the branch, "merge" at the merge point
- Use teal (#02c797) for branch lines and commit dots
- Use dimmed gray (#c6c6c6) for the main branch line (to contrast with the feature branch)
- Use white (#ffffff) for label text
- Smooth curves for branch/merge paths (use quadratic bezier `Q` commands)

**2. workflow-5-step.svg** (VIS-04) - 5-step Git workflow:
- viewBox="0 0 800 400"
- 5 numbered circles (or rounded rectangles) arranged horizontally, connected by arrows
- Steps: "Clone" -> "Branch" -> "Code + AI" -> "Pull Request" -> "Merge"
- Each step has a number (1-5) inside the shape and the label below
- Use teal (#02c797) for step shapes and arrow connectors
- Use white (#ffffff) for numbers and labels
- Arrows between steps using simple triangle arrowheads
- Clean spacing, centered composition

**3. ai-timeline.svg** (VIS-02) - AI tool evolution timeline:
- viewBox="0 0 800 400"
- Horizontal timeline line with year markers: 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026
- At each year, a vertical tick mark with a key milestone below or above (alternating):
  - 2022: "ChatGPT launches"
  - 2023: "GPT-4, Claude, Gemini"
  - 2024: "Cursor, Copilot Chat"
  - 2025: "Claude Code, Windsurf"
  - 2026: "AI writes production code"
- Use teal (#02c797) for the timeline line and year markers
- Use white (#ffffff) for milestone text
- Use bright teal (#04e6af) for the 2026 marker (current year emphasis)
- Subtle vertical connector lines from timeline to text labels

All SVGs should render well on dark backgrounds (transparent background, light-colored elements). Do NOT set a background fill on the SVG root element - the slide's dark background will show through.

  <verify>
Verify all 3 SVG files exist in docs/presentation/images/diagrams/. Open each file and confirm it contains valid SVG markup with the correct viewBox dimensions. Grep each file for theme colors (#02c797, #ffffff, #c6c6c6) to confirm palette adherence. Run `make build-marp` to confirm the build still works (images not yet referenced but build should not break).
  </verify>
  <done>3 SVG diagrams exist in docs/presentation/images/diagrams/ with theme-integrated colors, clean vector style, and responsive viewBox dimensions.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Apply split layouts and scoped styles to slides, then rebuild</name>
  <files>docs/presentation/slides.md</files>
  <action>
Apply Marp split layouts and scoped styles to the presentation slides. Follow the research-backed pattern: images LEFT, text RIGHT (cognitive processing research).

**Split layouts to apply (bg left with 50/50 split):**

1. **Branches slide** ("Branches Let You Experiment Without Risk"):
   Add `![bg left](images/diagrams/git-branching.svg)` as the first line after the slide delimiter. Keep existing content as-is on the right side. This satisfies VIS-01.

2. **Workflow overview slide** ("Five Steps from Clone to Merge"):
   Add `![bg left](images/diagrams/workflow-5-step.svg)` as the first line after the slide delimiter. Keep existing numbered list on the right side. This satisfies VIS-04.

3. **AI timeline slide** ("AI Coding Tools Evolved Rapidly Since 2022"):
   Add `![bg left](images/diagrams/ai-timeline.svg)` as the first line after the slide delimiter. Keep existing timeline bullets on the right side. This satisfies VIS-02.

**Scoped style blocks to add (at least 2):**

1. **Steps 1-2 slide** ("Steps 1-2: Get the Code and Create Your Branch"):
   Add a scoped style block to increase code block font size for better readability of the git commands:
   ```
   <style scoped>
   pre { font-size: 2.2rem; line-height: 1.6; }
   code { font-weight: 600; }
   </style>
   ```
   Place immediately after the slide delimiter (before the heading). This makes the `git clone` and `git checkout` commands more readable.

2. **Step 3 slide** ("Step 3: Let AI Write Code While You Steer"):
   Add a scoped style block to style the example prompt blockquote distinctively:
   ```
   <style scoped>
   blockquote { border-left: 4px solid #02c797; background: rgba(2, 199, 151, 0.1); padding: 0.8rem 1.2rem; font-size: 1.6rem; }
   li { font-size: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.2rem; }
   </style>
   ```
   Place immediately after the slide delimiter. This makes the AI prompt example visually distinct and tightens the list spacing since this slide has dense content.

3. (Optional - add if the deck audit reveals another candidate) **Three Categories slide** ("Three Categories of AI Coding Tools"):
   Add a scoped style block for the numbered list with slightly larger text:
   ```
   <style scoped>
   ol { font-size: 2rem; }
   ol li { margin-bottom: 1rem; }
   </style>
   ```

**Image path validation:** All image references must use relative paths from slides.md location: `images/diagrams/filename.svg` (since slides.md is at docs/presentation/slides.md and images are at docs/presentation/images/diagrams/).

**After all slide edits, rebuild the presentation artifact:**
Run `make build-marp` to regenerate docs/public/presentation.html. Then run `make build` to ensure the full VitePress build succeeds.

Do NOT modify speaker notes. Do NOT change the section break slides (those were handled in Plan 01). Do NOT add inline images to non-split slides (research anti-pattern).
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Grep slides.md for `bg left` - should find at least 3 occurrences (branches, workflow, timeline slides)
2. Grep slides.md for `style scoped` - should find at least 2 occurrences
3. Grep slides.md for `images/diagrams/` - should find 3 relative path references
4. Run `make build-marp` - presentation builds without errors
5. Run `make build` - full site builds without errors
6. Verify docs/public/presentation.html exists and is non-empty
7. Run `make format` to ensure code style compliance
  </verify>
  <done>At least 3 slides use bg left split layouts with SVG diagrams. At least 2 slides have scoped style blocks. All image references use relative paths. Presentation and site build successfully.</done>
