<objective>
Capture real tool screenshots (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot in VS Code, Claude Code terminal) and embed them in the tool category slides using Marp split layouts.

Purpose: Adds authenticity to the tool landscape section - participants see the actual interfaces they will encounter, not just text descriptions.
Output: 3 tool screenshots in docs/presentation/images/screenshots/, at least 1 embedded in a split layout slide.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create screenshot directory and placeholder guidance</name>
  <files>docs/presentation/images/screenshots/.gitkeep</files>
  <action>
Create the directory `docs/presentation/images/screenshots/` with a `.gitkeep` file. This directory will hold real tool screenshots captured by the user.

Expected files (to be provided by user):
- `chatgpt-interface.png` - ChatGPT conversation UI showing a coding question
- `copilot-vscode.png` - GitHub Copilot autocomplete suggestion visible in VS Code
- `claude-code-terminal.png` - Claude Code running in a terminal with visible output

Screenshots should be captured at 1920x1080 resolution for optimal quality in the presentation.
  </action>
  <verify>Directory docs/presentation/images/screenshots/ exists with .gitkeep file.</verify>
  <done>Screenshot directory structure is ready for user-provided captures.</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: User captures tool screenshots</name>
  <action>Capture screenshots of the 3 AI coding tool categories</action>
  <instructions>
Please capture these 3 screenshots and save them to `docs/presentation/images/screenshots/`:

1. **chatgpt-interface.png** - Open ChatGPT, ask a coding question (e.g., "How do I create a branch in Git?"), and screenshot the conversation showing the question and response. Capture at 1920x1080 or similar HD resolution.

2. **copilot-vscode.png** - Open VS Code with GitHub Copilot enabled, type a comment like `// function to validate gene ID` and show the autocomplete suggestion appearing. Screenshot the editor with the suggestion visible.

3. **claude-code-terminal.png** - Open a terminal with Claude Code, show a command like `claude "add a scoreboard to KidneyQuest"` with some visible output. Screenshot the terminal session.

**Tips:**
- Use dark theme in all tools (matches presentation theme)
- Crop to show the relevant UI area - no need for the full desktop
- PNG format, reasonable file size (under 500KB each if possible)
- Name files exactly as listed above

Type "screenshots ready" when all 3 files are saved, or provide whichever subset you have.
  </instructions>
  <resume-signal>Type "screenshots ready" or describe what you have available</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Embed screenshots in tool category slides with split layouts</name>
  <files>docs/presentation/slides.md</files>
  <action>
After screenshots are provided, embed them in the tool category slides using `bg left` split layouts. Apply to whichever slides have matching screenshots:

1. **Chat Tools slide** ("Chat Tools Are Best for Learning and Quick Questions"):
   Add `![bg left](images/screenshots/chatgpt-interface.png)` if chatgpt-interface.png was provided.

2. **Sidebar Tools slide** ("Sidebar Tools Integrate AI Into Your Editor"):
   Add `![bg left](images/screenshots/copilot-vscode.png)` if copilot-vscode.png was provided.

3. **CLI Agents slide** ("CLI Agents Automate Entire Tasks"):
   Add `![bg left](images/screenshots/claude-code-terminal.png)` if claude-code-terminal.png was provided.

For any slide that gets a screenshot split layout, review the text content on the right side - if it becomes too crowded at 50% width, add a `<style scoped>` block to tighten spacing:
```
<style scoped>
li { font-size: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.2rem; }
h1 { font-size: 2.8rem; }
</style>
```

After embedding, run `make build` to rebuild both the Marp presentation and VitePress site. Run `make format` for code style compliance.

If user provides fewer than 3 screenshots, embed whatever is available. Even 1 screenshot adds authenticity. Adapt accordingly.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Grep slides.md for `screenshots/` - should find references matching provided screenshots
2. Run `make build` - full site builds without errors
3. Verify docs/public/presentation.html exists and is non-empty
  </verify>
  <done>Available tool screenshots are embedded in their respective slides using split layouts. Presentation and site build successfully.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. docs/presentation/images/screenshots/ directory exists
2. At least 1 real tool screenshot is embedded in a slide with bg left split layout
3. `make build` completes without errors
4. Screenshot file paths use relative references from slides.md
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Real tool screenshots are captured and stored in docs/presentation/images/screenshots/
- At least one tool category slide uses a split layout with a real screenshot
- All images referenced with relative paths
- Full site builds successfully
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/07-visual-elements-and-marp-features/07-03-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
