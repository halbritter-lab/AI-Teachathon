## What to Expect

This is a hands-on, informal evening session — not a lecture. You'll be coding, experimenting, and learning by doing. We'll work together to build real projects using Git, GitHub, and AI coding assistants.

No prior coding or AI experience is required. We'll guide you through everything step-by-step, and you'll have plenty of support from the team and fellow participants. The goal is to learn practical skills you can use right away.

Bring your laptop with the setup guide completed beforehand. You'll need VS Code, Git, and a GitHub account — the setup takes about 15 minutes and ensures we can jump straight into the fun stuff.

You'll walk away with practical skills in Git, GitHub, and AI coding tools. More importantly, you'll see how AI can accelerate your work and make coding more accessible — whether you're building research tools, automating tasks, or just exploring new ideas.
