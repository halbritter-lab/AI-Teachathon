# Project Ideas

These are real project ideas from participants. Pick one that sounds interesting, or bring your own - the goal is to learn Git, GitHub, and AI tools by building something you care about.

## Featured Project: KidneyQuest

<div class="featured-card">

**An educational game about rare kidney diseases, built with web technologies and AI assistance.**

KidneyQuest is an interactive game that teaches players about rare kidney diseases. It connects to the CeRKiD zebra mascot (because rare diseases are like zebras - not horses). We'll build it together during the workshop using modern web tools and AI assistance.

This is the main project everyone will work on together. Follow the [hands-on guide](/hands-on) to get started.

**What you'll learn:**

- Setting up a web project with AI help
- Using GitHub for version control
- Building interactive features step by step
- Debugging and iterating with AI assistance

### Genomic Variant Effect Prediction

Use Google DeepMind's AlphaGenome API to predict how patient variants affect gene expression and chromatin accessibility.

This project starts from a Colab notebook, so you can run it entirely in your browser without installing anything locally. You'll learn how to call external APIs, handle genomic coordinate systems, and interpret AI predictions for clinical variants.

### Research Data Management Dashboard

Build a desktop app that handles data entry, stores everything in a local database, runs automated analysis, and displays results in visual dashboards.

Perfect if you work with structured research data and want a custom solution for your lab's workflow. You'll learn how to build cross-platform desktop apps, work with databases, and create interactive visualizations.

### AI-Assisted Academic Writing Pipeline

Combine Zotero (for managing references), QuillBot (for paraphrasing), and GPTZero (for checking AI detection) into a streamlined research writing workflow.

Learn how to chain different AI tools together and build a personal writing assistant. This project focuses on the practical workflow of writing papers: organizing references, improving clarity without plagiarism, and ensuring your writing sounds human.

### AI-Powered RNAseq Enrichment Summarizer

Feed enrichment analysis results to an LLM via API, get plain-language summaries of what the results mean, then validate those summaries using an LLM-as-judge approach.

Covers the full LLM workflow: designing prompts, handling structured data, avoiding hallucinations, and validating outputs. You'll learn how to use AI APIs programmatically, not just through chat interfaces.

## What Could AI Help With?

Don't have a specific project yet? Here are common research pain points where AI tools can help. Pick one that matches your daily frustrations and explore it during the hands-on session.

### Common Research Pain Points

<div class="pain-point-grid">

<div class="pain-point-card">

#### Literature Review

Ask AI to read papers, extract key findings, and compare methodologies across studies. Great for getting up to speed on a new topic.

</div>

<div class="pain-point-card">

#### Data Cleaning

Transform messy datasets into tidy formats, handle missing values, or convert between file types. AI can write scripts to automate tedious data prep.

</div>

<div class="pain-point-card">

#### Manuscript Writing

Generate first drafts of methods sections, improve clarity, or adapt tone for different audiences. Overcome writer's block and polish rough drafts.

</div>

<div class="pain-point-card">

#### Debugging Code

Paste error messages and get explanations, suggested fixes, and prevention strategies. AI excels at pattern matching in error logs.

</div>

<div class="pain-point-card">

#### Boilerplate Code

Create starter templates for common tasks like data visualization, statistical tests, or file I/O. Save time on repetitive patterns.

</div>

<div class="pain-point-card">

#### Data Visualization

Describe what you want to show, and AI can suggest plot types and generate the code. Useful for exploratory analysis or publication figures.
