# Project Ideas

These are real project ideas from participants. Pick one that sounds interesting, or bring your own -- the goal is to learn Git, GitHub, and AI tools by building something you care about.

## Featured Project: KidneyQuest

**An educational game about rare kidney diseases, built with web technologies and AI assistance.**

KidneyQuest is an interactive game that teaches players about rare kidney diseases. It connects to the CeRKiD zebra mascot (because rare diseases are like zebras -- not horses). We'll build it together during the workshop using modern web tools and AI assistance.

This is the main project everyone will work on together. Follow the [hands-on guide](/hands-on) to get started.

**What you'll learn:**

- Setting up a web project with AI help
- Using GitHub for version control
- Building interactive features step by step
- Debugging and iterating with AI assistance

## Alternative Project Ideas

Looking to explore something different? These ideas come from fellow participants.

### Genomic Variant Effect Prediction with AlphaGenome

Use Google DeepMind's AlphaGenome API to predict how patient variants affect gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Great for learning API integration and working with genomic data.

This project starts from a Colab notebook, so you can run it entirely in your browser without installing anything locally. You'll learn how to call external APIs, handle genomic coordinate systems, and interpret AI predictions for clinical variants.

**Stack:** Python, Google Colab, AlphaGenome API

**Good for:** Learning API integration, working with genomic data formats, understanding AI predictions

### Research Data Management Dashboard

Build a desktop app that handles data entry, stores everything in a local database, runs automated analysis, and displays results in visual dashboards.

This project is perfect if you work with structured research data and want a custom solution for your lab's workflow. You'll learn how to build cross-platform desktop apps, work with databases, and create interactive visualizations. AI can help generate forms, write SQL queries, and create chart configurations.

**Stack:** Electron, Vue/Vite, SQLite

**Good for:** Building desktop tools, database design, creating custom lab workflows

### AI-Assisted Academic Writing Pipeline

Combine Zotero (for managing references), QuillBot (for paraphrasing), and GPTZero (for checking AI detection) into a streamlined research writing workflow.

Learn how to chain different AI tools together and build a personal writing assistant. This project focuses on the practical workflow of writing papers: organizing references, improving clarity without plagiarism, and ensuring your writing sounds human. Great for anyone who writes academic papers.

**Stack:** Zotero, QuillBot, GPTZero, markdown editor

**Good for:** Academic writing workflows, tool integration, understanding AI detection

### AI-Powered RNAseq Enrichment Summarizer

Feed enrichment analysis results to an LLM via API, get plain-language summaries of what the results mean, then validate those summaries using an LLM-as-judge approach. Covers prompt design, hallucination avoidance, validation techniques, and API usage.

**Stack:** Python, OpenAI/Anthropic API

## What Could AI Help With?

Don't have a specific project yet? Here are common research pain points where AI tools can help:

- **Literature review and summarization** -- Ask AI to read papers, extract key findings, and compare methodologies across studies.
- **Data cleaning and reformatting** -- Transform messy datasets into tidy formats, handle missing values, or convert between file types.
- **Writing and editing manuscripts** -- Generate first drafts of methods sections, improve clarity, or adapt tone for different audiences.
- **Debugging code and scripts** -- Paste error messages and get explanations, suggested fixes, and prevention strategies.
- **Generating boilerplate code** -- Create starter templates for common tasks like data visualization, statistical tests, or file I/O.
- **Creating visualizations from data** -- Describe what you want to show, and AI can suggest plot types and generate the code.
